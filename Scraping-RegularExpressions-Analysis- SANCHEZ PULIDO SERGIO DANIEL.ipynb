Using a policy-design framework, we identify a causal mechanism linking the opening of a policy window to policy change as a combination of the emergence of a new policy network, the adoption of a new policy paradigm and the selection of a new instruments mix. Drawing on Bayesian statistics, the 11 tests conducted on the causal mechanism show the importance of State resources of information, authority, treasury and organization to assess the outcome of policy change.',\n",

This paper addresses this gap by examining how universities contribute to social innovation in Colombia. In seeking to develop a good understanding of how universities can contribute to the development of social innovation niches, we draw upon the Strategic Niche Management theory and the three areas of activity which constitute effective niche-building: social networks, expectations and visions and learning. We explore this phenomenon with the Parque Científico de Innovación Social, founded by Uniminuto University in 2012, using video case study research methodology. Findings suggest the important role played by Uniminuto University influencing the current higher education system regime by enhancing the development of social innovation niches. These results have implications for advancing the debate on the role of higher education institutions in contributing to the development of social innovation processes.Poca literatura ha analizado el papel de las universidades promoviendo y apoyando las innovaciones sociales de base.

In this sense, the objective of this article is to identify the relationship between innovation and internationalization in the services sector in Colombia in order to understand their low participation in exports. Thus, a reference framework on the services sector is presented and a quantitative descriptive analysis of the EDITS information is carried out. From this analysis, it is concluded that the number of companies with innovation activities has decreased, that the few results of these activities are not oriented to the international markets and that they are financed almost entirely by the companies in the face of the low level of public support.ResumenEl sector servicios se ha constituido como el más importante de la economía nacional con una participación del 51.1% del PIB en el 2014, sin embargo, en ese mismo año, representó menos del 0.2% en las exportaciones del país.

Four hundred and ninety-two surveys were applied to SME managers in Cali, Bogotá, and Medellín to meet such an objective. This research made it evident that human resource management practices affect innovation, but not all practices exert the same influence.

The steady dynamics of science, technology and innovation plus the volume of information that these subjects have, represent a challenge to the research groups endeavor and to the commitment of the later ones to be knowledge developing units that give significant outputs to its social and academic settings. Therefore, there must be a planning alternative that supports the decisionmaking processes in order to give it a better knowledge founding, to reduce the possible risks and to think ahead the possible changes. This alternative must be supportedby an organized, selective and systematic procedure, such as the technological surveillance. Objective. To create a descriptive literature review regarding technological surveillance and a proposal for the technological surveillance method applied to the management of scientific activity of the Estudio Genetico de Enfermedades Complejas (EGEC – Genetic Study for Complex Diseases) research group. Methodology. Descriptive literature review. The following academic databases were consulted: Medline, SciELO, Ebsco e IEEE and Google Scholar search engine. The combination of keywords used when consulting the academic databases, was “vigilancia tecnológica/technological surveillance”, “salud/health”, “enfermedad/disease”, “ejemplos en salud”, “universidad” and “investigación”. Articles of the last five years are included, while articles that only had to deal with the results dissemination of technological surveillance exercises, were excluded. Based on the literature review analysis of results, a technological surveillance model is proposed which its objective is to manage the EGEC research group’s scientific activities. In order to do so, a stages, inputs and funds diagrams that integrated the surveillance model, were created. Thus, the already mentioned diagrams included a cancer pilot test as a validation strategy, and with the test results, the model was subjected to additional adjustments.Results. The Spanish standard UNE 166006:2011 created by the Spanish Association for Standarization and Certification (AENOR), was taken as an international reference whilst the program España y sus Regiones Intercambian Conocimiento con Antioquia (ERICA) and the methodology for technological surveillance Innovaciones a partir de la Vigilancia Tecnológica (InnoViTech), were taken as national referents. Additionally, conceptual stages, good practices for processes execution and defined budget for the development of technological surveillance, are established. The main components for the proposed model include needs identification, plus the planning, collection, auditing, analysis, documentation, and information spreading processes. Conclusions. The proposed model works as a foundation for developing a knowledge management strategy of a research group. Also, the model highlights the importance of climbing towards the usage of competitive intelligence systems within itself. [CarrilloZambrano E, Páez-Leal MC, Suárez JM, Luna-González ML.

       " 'El objetivo fundamental de esta investigación fue identificar las habilidades gerenciales para una cultura de innovación universitaria en instituciones de Colombia y Venezuela. Para cumplir con el objetivo, se estudiaron las bases teóricas de los autores Horth y Buchner (2009), Dyer, Gregersen y Christensen (2012) y Thomas (2010), entre otros. La metodología utilizada fue bajo el paradigma de investigación positivista y la investigación fue descriptiva con un diseño no experimental, transeccional y de campo. La población estuvo constituida por 60 docentes de cada universidad. Como instrumento para la recolección de datos se elaboró un cuestionario utilizando las categorías de respuestas de tipo Likert de 33 ítems, validado por siete expertos en el área. La confiabilidad del instrumento fue determinada por el método Alfa de Cronbach y presentó un 0,94 de confiabilidad. Los resultados de la investigación permiten evidenciar un bajo porcentaje tanto en las habilidades necesarias para ser innovadores, como en las habilidades de descubrimiento, por lo que se concluye la ausencia de las habilidades gerencialespara una cultura de innovación universitaria en instituciones de educación superior de Colombia y Venezuela.',\n",
       " 'Un aspecto que permite reconocer el fomento a la innovación en un país se corresponde con la cantidad de patentes solicitadas y otorgadas por este. Entendiendo que, de esta manera, se puede reconocer la dinámica en que el conocimiento se genera y apropia con fines industriales y comerciales. En este contexto, se busca establecer un panorama tecnológico colombiano, basado en las patentes presentadas entre los años 2000 a 2018, según los titulares asociados, así como su origen y naturaleza como persona natural o jurídica (empresas o universidades). Como resultado de este ejercicio se ratifica la percepción generalizada de que en el país se protegen principalmente desarrollos asociados con el sector farmacéutico, encontrando que esto se presenta para el caso de titulares no residentes en el país; mientras que para los residentes el mayor interés se genera por parte de personas naturales sin una especialidad técnica concreta. Por otro lado, se encuentra que las patentes no necesariamente representan un factor de competitividad en el mercado, sino un factor de estatus o distinción para el caso de los nacionales y una herramienta de protección de mercado para los extranjeros. Esto último dado que los objetos de protección por patente en su gran mayoría no se fabrican en el país sino que solo se comercializan.',\n",
       " 'ResumenFue aplicada la metodología del Radar de la Innovación (Innoradar). Los resultados de este análisis indican que todavía hay un largo camino por recorrer para que las empresas, sin importar su tamaño, incorporen conceptos modernos asociados con la investigación, desarrollo tecnológico y la innovación (IDT+I). También se recalca la importancia y el significado de adoptar la gestión estratégica de la tecnología y la innovación como parte de su estrategia corporativa. ',\n",
       " 'El objetivo del presente estudio es analizar la calidad de servicios ofrecida por el Centro Cardiovascular del Magdalena- Colombia, para optimizar la atención prestada a sus usuarios. Se fundamenta en un enfoque positivista, con un diseño de investigación no experimental, de campo, transversal; y un tipo de estudio descriptivo, bajo la modalidad de estudio de caso. La población está conformada por dicho centro, el cual recibe un promedio de 550 personas (usuarios) por mes cuenta con 35 trabajadores, los informantes clave fueron 210 usuarios de los servicios quienes decidieron participar de forma voluntaria y 20 trabajadores, para un total de 230. La técnica empleada fue la encuesta a través de un cuestionario. Los resultados evidencian una tendencia alta a considerar profundamente la calidad del servicio; integrando mayor tecnología en la comunicación y mejorando sustancialmente los servicios de atención, así como también conocer las necesidades específicas del cliente. Los usuarios y acompañantes manifestaron que el centro de diagnóstico cuenta con mediana tecnología. Se concluye que en el Centro Cardiovascular la prestación del servicio según la percepción de usuarios y acompañantes es de excelente calidad, sin embargo, puede mejorar en la medida en que se incorporen elementos innovadores en el servicio.']"

       "['The objective of this article was to evaluate the trends of scientific production in Economics with Colombian institutional affiliation during the period 2007-2019. A bibliometric analysis was carried out from the information registered in Scopus, through indicators of production, citation and collaboration and the quantitative exploratory analysis method, using the Biblioshiny, Vantage Point and VOSviewer software. The behavior of authors, journals and topics of higher publication visibility such as innovation and economic growth were studied. The main trends in the scientific production of Colombian authors with the highest publication in Scopus, present an annual average growth rate of 13%, in addition to publications in prestigious journals and important networks of national and international collaboration and predominance of coauthored publications (index of 1.8), expanding the connection not only at the level of higher education institutions, but through research institutes. The knowledge of the dynamics of disciplinary research in the study, contributed with information for the management of the scientific activity and the design of future research in Colombia. © 2021 Universidad de Antioquia.

       " 'The main aim of this paper is to establish the hidden incidences that can improve specific aspects of beekeeper Small and Medium Enterprises (SME) innovation capabilities in Boyacá-Colombia. The methodology is focused on the use of the expertons model, adequacy coefficient and forgotten effects theory. A questionnaire of 58 items about different innovation management areas is distributed to 14 beekeeper SMEs in the area of Boyacá-Colombia. The findings suggest that there are two specific actions that can improve innovation culture. These actions are related to marketing strategies and product innovation. The innovation strategy has a significant influence on the development of an innovative culture in the beekeeper SMEs; one must have a clear orientation to the innovation objectives in the marketing strategy, which is transferred to the product. Likewise, the utility of fuzzy methods for analysis when information is limited, subjective and scarce is highlighted. Finally, this research can be useful to practitioners and academics because the findings can serve as guidelines to understanding sources and enablers of innovation. In addition, the findings show how fuzzy methods help in contending with incomplete and subjective information, highlighting the meaning of the information rather than its measurement. © 2021, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.',\n",
       " 'Cooperatives with financial activity stimulate the economy by providing economic resources to individuals and companies that cannot access the banking sector or prefer to belong to the cooperative sector. The objective is to analyze the economic and social impact of these cooperatives in the cities of Montería and Ibagué, Colombia, considering their determining attributes. The study is descriptive with a quantitative approach and 32 financial cooperatives participated. A questionnaire validated by expert judgment and a Cronbach’s Alpha coefficient of 0.815. The results show that the type of user, contracting modality, product offering, surplus growth, investments and advertising strategies, are some of the determining attributes in the management of the cooperatives with financial activity. It is concluded that these entities have an economic and social impact that is reflected in the quality of life of their associates, their families and their environment. Investing in technology and innovation is recommended to meet current and future challenges facing the cooperative sector. © 2021, Universidad del Zulia. All rights reserved.',\n",
       " 'Achieving multi-million-hectare commitments from countries around the world to restore degraded lands in resilient and sustainable ways requires, among other things, huge volumes of tree planting material. Seed systems encompassing all forest reproductive material (e.g., seeds, cuttings, stakes, and wildings), are key to ensuring that sufficient planting material with a diverse range of suitable species, adapted to local conditions and capable of persisting under a changing climate, is available for restoration projects. The ideal structure of a seed system integrates five components: seed selection and innovation, seed harvesting and production, market access, supply and demand, quality control, and an enabling environment. We propose 15 indicators to evaluate these key components and trial them by assessing national seed systems in 7 Latin American countries. We conclude that the indicators enable a straightforward assessment of the strengths and weaknesses of national seed systems, thus assisting governments to identify key areas for improvement and opportunities for horizontal learning. © 2021 by the authors.

       " 'It is widely recognized that the design and application of suitable and robust science, technology and innovation (STI) policies and appropriate STI institutions promote development, economic growth and competitiveness in the long run. This paper analyses the dynamics of STI in Colombia over the 1995–2019 period to determine its relationship with its most important determinants and its collateral relationship with economic growth as an input affecting different issues; this work takes into account the creation of the new ministry of science, technology and innovation (MSTI) and uses different time series techniques. According to the analysis, a positive relationship exists between investments in research and development, STI activities, and the independence and transparency of STI management by the new MSTI, which could generate higher productivity, technological change, economic growth and development. The results of the models also demonstrate the long-run relationship and short-run dynamics related to STI investment and research results and the importance of transparency and independence. It is important to establish adequate STI governance and allow new ministries to play an important role to achieve a society based on knowledge that produces relevant research, technology and innovation based on the needs and resources of the country. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.',\n",

A literature review was carried out to select the variables that most effectively represent the analysed behaviour. The methodology was a quantitative study based on theories technology adoption such as the planned behaviour model, the model of the theory of technology adoption, and the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology. The data was collected in Medellin Colombia by means of surveying taxi drivers who use MTB Apps.

       " \"In 2018, the Colombian Ministry of Health and Social Protection, in collaboration with the National Health Institute and the Pan American Health Organization, convened all actors associated with the National Tuberculosis Prevention and Control Program (PNPCT) and the National Science, Technology, and Innovation System to form a national network to coordinate operations research on tuberculosis (TB) in the country. Seven workshops were held and a consensus was reached to establish the National Network for Knowledge Management, Research, and Innovation in Tuberculosis in Colombia (TB Colombia Network). With more than 180 participants, a central node, and five regional nodes that bring together the country's 37 territorial entities, the TB Colombia Network conducted four days of training in operations research in 2019, defining 65 priority research topics aligned with the strategic lines in the PNPCT: prevention and comprehensive care, with a focus on people affected by TB (41 topics in three modules); and political commitment, social protection, and support systems (24 topics in four modules). The peer comparison method was used for prioritization. The TB Colombia Network remains active and contributes to knowledge management aimed at eliminating TB in Colombia. It has helped make progress in building plans and implementing local operations research projects that generate scientifically validated results to strengthen the PNPCT and improve the care of TB patients. © 2021 Pan American Health Organization.

       " 'In this research study an integrated quality management system is proposed for academic programs in Colombian higher education by considering the Colombian legal requirements and high quality accreditation guidelines, and the ISO 9001 standard. Concepts associated with high quality assurance, quality management, and excellence models in higher education were used as theoretical frameworks. There were three standards used: the Colombia decree 1330 of 2019, the ISO 9001 standard, and the Colombian Agreement 1 of 2020, which establishes the accreditation factors for higher education in Colombia.

       " 'Scientific capabilities are a concept subordinated to the productivity metrics of classical scientometrics. This has generated a series of management and evaluation processes of university scientific activity that constrain the understanding of the capacities generated by the institutions themselves. Even in the application of their instruments and policy models, productivity plateaus are achieved that raise questions about the possibility of sustainability and governance of these capacities. The chapter proposes a redefinition of the notion of science, technology, and innovation (STI) capabilities that go beyond the comparison of the relative competitive weight or value of one group with respect to another, but rather in terms of the heterogeneity between types of scientific and technological activity that universities carry out. For this purpose, we conceptualize the university as a complex adaptive system (CAS) in order to propose a methodology for evaluating the expected or planned results in the three missions—training, research, and extension—, in terms of the activation of governance mechanisms. In this context, this chapter focuses, exemplifies, and learns from the analysis and experience of modeling the STI capabilities of the Universidad del Valle de Colombia, through which we offer an alternative to strengthening the governance and management of the university mission. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.',\n",
       " 'This chapter proposes the concept of Community-Based Innovation Ecosystem, as a framework for analysing communal and transformative innovation processes, particularly in territories affected by armed and social conflicts. In this way, it questions the conventional notion of innovation as a transactional process to open new markets in capitalism, towards a re-signified notion, as a sociotechnical process of collective transformation linked to actions carried out by grassroots organizations and communities. Therefore, the ecology of innovation is used as a biological metaphor for the studies of management and innovation. The case of the Guajuí River Community Council in Guapi—Colombia is described and analysed through the relationships between diverse, historically excluded actors through collaboration in post-conflict or post-agreement contexts. Finally, a series of conclusions are presented regarding the interdependent dynamics of the actors in Guapi, their limitations, opportunities, and future lines of action. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.',\n",
       " 'Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to examine the enablers and barriers influencing international knowledge transfer at the team-level in the context of product innovation within an emerging-market multinational enterprise (EMNE) in the insurance industry. Design/methodology/approach: The research applies an exploratory case study design considering an emerging-market multinational insurance company headquartered in Colombia. Four subsidiaries (El Salvador, Chile, Argentina and Colombia) and the Corporate Office (headquarter) served as the research sites. It also adopts an interpretive research approach providing a grounded theory framework linking international knowledge transfer and product innovation. Findings: The empirical findings emphasize the central role played by the enablers (i.e. shared vision, empathy and knowledge sources) in facilitating international knowledge transfer, which, in turn, enhances product innovation. More important, however, is the detailed explanation that the paper provides regarding the enablers’ microfoundational antecedents in terms of key activities that are performed at the team-level. Research limitations/implications: The grounded theory framework was constructed using data collected in a single firm associated with a particular industry and regional context. The study only considered a single aspect of knowledge management (i.e. knowledge transfer). Other aspects of knowledge management systems, such as knowledge creation and knowledge application, should be used for explaining product innovation in EMNEs more comprehensively. Practical implications: The study suggests a set of enabling conditions and activities that should be adopted by managers of EMNEs to improve international knowledge transfer with the aim of triggering product innovation. This includes the design of strategies for strengthening empathy among geographically dispersed teams by providing opportunities for regular live videoconferences among team members aimed at building close bonds, fostering trust and creating a sense of belonging in which participants get to know each other better and to establish a shared vision and a set of guiding principles and commitments for how the team will work. These suggestions are particularly important today when several multinational enterprises (MNEs) have been forced to rearrange their workplace by replacing face-to-face interactions with virtual work dynamics due to the COVID-19 crisis. Originality/value: Previous studies have confirmed that international knowledge transfer positively influences MNEs’ innovative performance. However, no studies have been conducted linking both variables in the context of EMNEs in Latin America in the service sector. The research tries to fill this gap. Besides, the paper introduces empathy as a novel enabler for international knowledge transfer and a moderator able to diminish the negative effect that cultural differences and geographical barriers have on the knowledge transfer process. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.',\n",

This paper aims to identify how grassroots innovation practices take place and are shaped in ‘El Faro’, a self-built settlement at the urban border of the city of Medellín; and how these have allowed the social transformation of health and well-being. This was done from a qualitative approach with an interpretative scope, under the case study methodology. ‘El Faro’ is a space built by its inhabitants, in a process that they have called \"dignity and resistance\", becoming the promoter of what we identify as four ‘grassroots innovation practices’ developed around three main issues: community water management, artistic training and the creation of community public spaces. This process has allowed them, from the capacity of agency, to understand their poverty situation and face it, modifying the conditions that reproduce it and responding to unsatisfied basic needs, based on innovative solutions that guarantee conditions of life with dignity and well-being. Likewise, it generates mechanisms that reduce inequality because the community becomes the main driving agent for the construction of the city and the transformation of the health-disease process, through its community assets. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd',\n",

       " \"Purpose: This study provides empirical evidence on the innovations that Nonprofit Organizations (NPOs) in Colombia have implemented within their own management to address social problems which are the object of their institutional mission. Design/methodology: This research is based on information obtained from a survey applied to executives of Colombian NPOs. Multiple linear regression models were developed to check the partial effect of the set of independent variables (Organizational and Social Innovation) over the dependent variable (Organizational Performance). Main Components Analysis was applied to grouping the considered variables. Findings: Empirical evidence indicates that Colombian NPOs are innovative organizations that advisedly follow management strategies for this purpose. Colombian NPOs have been innovating for their disposition to tackle the social problems implicated in their institutional mission. Evidence indicates that the main components derived from NPOs' organizational and social innovations are grouped into four: NPO innovation actions to adapt to the environment; internal innovation actions to improve NPO's performance; variables related with NPO innovation actions to improve their relations with external agents; innovation actions aimed at improving the management of social interventions associated with the mission of the NPOs and the management of institutional projects. Research limitations/implications: The field work only used the survey technique to obtain the information and only assessed the perception of one of the directors of each of the NPOs participating in the study in terms of both the actions of organizational innovation such as social innovation and organizational performance. Therefore, the study undoubtedly presents bias in that perception. The technique used for the selection of the sample of the participants was a non-probabilistic sampling, which implies bias in the information and therefore, limitation for the generalization of the results to other contexts. The geographical location of the administration of the NPOs was restricted to Bogota and surrounding municipalities. Originality/value: An analysis of the relationship between social and organizational innovations with organizational performance in NPOs was carried out in the context of an emerging economy, where the subject has been very little studied and much less with principal component analysis.

       " \"Purpose: This paper investigates the impact of adopting quality management standards like ISO9001 on a firm's performance and the mediator role of human capabilities within firms in this relationship. The article analyses this mediator effect in the context of an emerging economy that set a policy reform aimed at increase ISO adoption and with a large share of informal labour markets. Design/methodology/approach: This study implements a quantitative approach, applying a Difference in Differences-DiD model with a Propensity Score Matching on fixed effect panel data analysis of a sample of certified and non-certified firms using firm-level data obtained from the national statistics office of Colombia. This methodology allows having comparable groups before the policy implementation. It reduces differences in observable characteristics and controls for parallel trends in primary outcomes before the policy reform. Findings: The research findings suggest that after Colombian policy reform of the quality system (2006), firms that adopted ISO 9001 certification increased innovation (5.2%), labour productivity (4.6%), sales (5.7%) and wages (4.9%). Furthermore, it shows that the share of permanent workers is an essential mediator in adopting quality programs. Adopters firms with a large percentage of temporary workers weaken their initial investment in quality infrastructure. Research limitations/implications: This research does not consider one key aspect. This is the lack of information about the organizational culture inside Colombian organizations that is related to a successful implementation of Quality Management standards like ISO 9001. However, it does not affect the conclusion about the mediation effect of human capital in the relationship between ISO 9001 and firm performance. Practical implications: The study covered all the Colombian manufacturing firms with ten or more employees. It provides critical insight for managers to value implementing ISO 9001 certification and appropriately put attention to enhancing their firms' human capital in emerging economies. Also, a policy implication of the paper is that governmental efforts to strengthen quality infrastructure in emerging economies should also include steps to increase a firm's investment in human capital. Originality/value: This study provides further support for government policies to strengthen firms' incentives to adopt modern management practices. The strong effects of implementing these management practices on sales, productivity and innovation have been identified. Furthermore, the investments in quality infrastructure must be accompanied by investment in human capital and workforce stability. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.\",\n",
       " 'Introduction. Surgical management of chest wall lesions with resection and reconstruction with prosthetic material has been increasing, due to advances in surgical techniques and surgeon’s experience, as well as innovation and characteristics of prosthetic materials. They allow wide resections of the wall, guaranteeing greater skeletal stability, less alteration of respiratory mechanics, and better aesthetic results. Methods. The experience in the CardioVID clinic, Medellín, Colombia, between the years 2015 and 2019, is presented through a retrospective review of eight cases that underwent resection of benign lesions of the chest wall and reconstruction with prosthetic material. Results. An adequate evolution of the patients was found, with a good aesthetic and functional result, with adequate control of the disease, without reports of complications or recurrence in follow-up. Discussion. An adequate technique allows the reconstruction of these defects with minimal complications and low prosthesis extraction rates, ending with excellent functional and cosmetic results. With our experience, we can conclude that the proper choice of patients who are good candidates for surgical management, a good surgical technique, and an experienced staff are crucial to achieve good results in terms of lung function and aesthetics results, in addition to obtain survival under the established parameters after achieving an R0 resection. © 2021, Asociacion Colombiana de Cirugia.

Through the means of community identified problems, its main goal was to promote community associative capabilities and socioenvironmental appropriation of territories in order to generate alternative methods of sustainable and sustained development. Methods such as People-centered design, Participatory Action Research and Environmental Education were applied. Results showed that social actors managed to devise, drive and deliver innovative and feasible solutions which made it possible to contribute to the objective of sustainable development and overall pollution reduction in the area. The design applied herein allowed for a collective vision to be built in order to direct community potentials and propose new forms of governance, in relevant elements of economic, social and environmental development of the rural sector. The study concludes that community efforts and their organizational capacity permitted the implementation of a social innovation model focused around the use of solid waste. This model can be replicated in rural areas at the national level, thus contributing towards the mitigation of adverse effects related to anthropic activities. Finally, community actions can influence public policies and participate in the overall transformation of local environment and territories. © 2021, CEDDAR. All rights reserved.',\n",

Endogenous growth and integrationist organizational culture were the theoretical approaches followed by this study. The methodology was de-veloped in two stages: first, the relationship between innovation, human capital and production level was addressed from a longitudinal statistical analysis of the Survey of Technological Development and Innovation in the Manufacturing Industry; afterward, involvement and adaptability factors of the Denison Model were measured through the direct application of a survey to companies in the plastics sector. We found that the impact of staff skills on production is significant and that such impact increases when observing staff with higher education attainment. Besides, involvement and adaptability factors were located in intermediate areas in which the efficient use of production resources is moderate. © 2021, Universidad Nacional de Colombia.

Several management and technological options with enteric methane mitigation potential have been evaluated and their scaling is anticipated to contribute toward achieving GHG emission reduction targets in the framework of the Paris Agreement. Yet, widespread adoption of promising mitigation options remains limited, raising questions as to whether envisaged emission reduction targets are achievable. Using findings from local studies, we explore the mitigation potentials of technologies and management practices currently proposed to mitigate enteric methane emissions from cattle production systems in the higher emitting countries of Latin America. We then discuss barriers for adopting innovations that significantly reduce cattle-based enteric methane emissions and the major shifts in policy and practice that are needed to raise national ambitions in the high emitting countries. Using the latest science and current thinking, we provide our perspective on an inclusive approach and re-imagine how the academic, research, business and public policy sectors can support and incentivize the changes needed to raise the level of ambition and achieve sustainable development goals (SDG), considering actions from the farm to the national scale. © Copyright © 2020 Arango, Ruden, Martinez-Baron, Loboguerrero, Berndt, Chacón, Torres, Oyhantcabal, Gomez, Ricci, Ku-Vera, Burkart, Moorby and Chirinda.',\n",

In Colombia, few buildings have an energy management system characterized by its adaptability to the user and with a certain degree of intelligence. Thus, this document describes the summarized research process for the development of an Internet of Things (IoT) system, which has been designed to promote an intelligent lighting service in an academic environment. The IoT system orchestrates a series of sensors, monitoring systems and controlled actions, all based on the principle of making the system functions and consumption records available in real-time, via web services. The devices used are \\'Things\\' with improved functionality, becoming \"Smart Things\"within the IoT paradigm. Methodologically, an experimental process was followed, linking the development of electronic tools, the construction of services, and the development of interfaces for a pleasant user experience. Research contributes to two essential areas: intelligent buildings, through the intelligent adaptation of an environment; and sustainability and eco-innovation, since the system provides appropriate information for environmental education, in terms of real-time energy consumption, that impacts directly on the fair-use culture of a service expensive for the environment.

       " \"Generating new products, services, or technologies may require drawing on available entrepreneurial human resources within the firm. Allowing an organizational climate in which employees engage as internal entrepreneurs can serve as a conduit for in-house generation of innovations. In order to sustain such innovative activity within a firm, corporate entrepreneurship integrates intentional and visible organizational conducts to engage employees in entrepreneurial behaviours that allow for revitalization and strategic renewal. In an understanding that an organizational climate influences employees behaviors, studies have found that certain organizational dimensions can increase employees' perceptions of organizational support that elicit their willingness to pursue entrepreneurial initiatives. In emerging and developing economies prevails a disparity on the capacity of firms to create an organizational climate that taps into the entrepreneurial behaviors of employees. In Latin America, even though many companies develop some type of innovation, the innovative performance of many firms lags significantly behind that of developed economies. The aim of this paper is to assess the perception of employees on five key dimensions in ten Latin American firms located in Colombia, Ecuador, Mexico, and Honduras from five different industries. To this end, the Corporate Entrepreneurship Climate Instrument (CECI) was applied to assess (1) top management support, (2) employee autonomy, (3) rewards/reinforcement, (4) time availability, and (5) organizational boundaries. Results from multivariate analysis show that the role of top managers within the company appears as one of the main inhibitors to entrepreneurial behaviour, highlighting the need for improving top management's sensitivity to supporting entrepreneurial activity of employees. Findings also reveal that employees perceive a weakness of organizational resources and incentives to entrepreneurial behavior. The practical implication of this exploratory study is that as long as traditional managerial conducts are not transformed, entrepreneurial individuals will not flourish in detriment of higher innovative organizational performance. © 2020 Academic Conferences and Publishing International Limited.

       " \"The results of the design and validation of an Intellectual Capital (CI) management model for the quality of IES, Colombia 2014-2016 are shown. Applied research, mixed-nature. The qualitative approach was from the confrontation of the theory with the specific conditions of the object addressed (its characteristics and needs) which allowed the design of the model. The quantitative data approach was statistical. The population corresponds to the educational actors (teachers, students, administrative and management) of the medicine program, a total of 2139. The sampling was stratified and to determine the size of each of the stratum, took into account the population variances of the same and opted to use the criterion of Neyman's Affixation. For data analysis, they were presented in frequency distribution tables, with range and confidence interval measurements at 95 % (CI-95 %). Also, to observe the relationship between the variables (aspects) and the actors, a simple correspondence analysis was performed. All information was processed in the R-CRAN program. Seven surveys were designed which were validated by experts in higher education, who qualified coherence with the objectives of the study, the shape of the instrument and the clarity of the questions. The analysis of theories on intellectual capital allowed the design of the systemic-dynamic model of management of intellectual capital for the quality of institutions of higher education-SIDIGCIES, is based on three theories: Theory of dynamic capacities in the business world, of Teece, Pisano and Shuen; And, Theory of knowledge creation of Nonaka and Takeuchi. The guidelines of the National Accreditation Council (CNA) of Colombia were also taken into account for both programs and institutions. It is structured by four dynamic subsystems: human talent, research and innovation, academic administration and Social recognition. Its name is due to the way the management of intellectual capital in the IES must work, which requires an interconnected system, whose relationship is developed in a dynamic and non-static way when it is constantly moving, constantly improving and Adjustments, in constant internal interaction in each one of its elements and with the external medium. It is precisely the continuous interaction between the members of the Organization and other external agents in a careful way, which leads to the creation of new knowledge. Around the dynamic subsystems the elements that make possible the promotion and distribution of knowledge are undulating, they are: tacit knowledge, explicit knowledge, organizational knowledge and inter-organizational knowledge. In turn, the dynamic subsystems are influenced by four elements that directly affect their integral behavior and the achievement of the objectives of the IES. Without them, is not possible effective management of intellectual Capital; these are: Financial condition, national and international context, ethical-Legal aspects and physical infrastructure and material resources. The validation of the model in a medical program showed the relevance of SIDIGCIES, with the national and international requirements established for the accreditation of programs and institutions. We achieved the design of 92 indicators for measurement, distributed in each of the subsystems with this is possible a comprehensive analysis of their reality and not fractionally. Seven instruments were also designed for the actors of the teaching-learning process duly validated, counting in this way with reliable tools of measurement of the management of the CI SIDIGCIES, that allows the systematic and interdisciplinary study, oriented to identify the intellectual resources to share, employ, keep and protect them at the individual, organizational, social and global levels. It is a tool that will orient the proper management of the CI, will motivate the recognition of the value of the human talent for the production of the intangibles that there are produced, towards the recognition of the quality by the society and the State. © 2020 Centro Interamericano de Investigaciones Psicologicas y Ciencias Afines.\",\n",

The study was done using a qualitative methodology that included semi-structured interviews with tourism actors, with four main dimensions: social, economic, political, and environmental. The research revealed that, after the signing of the peace treaty, tourism in previously conflict-affected regions significantly increased due to the growth of privately owned tourism enterprises focused on profit making. However, levels of sustainable development, community involvement, and social entrepreneurship initiatives remain low; hence, the tourism value chain needs to be strengthened with local community involvement in order to reconstruct the social fabric. This can be done with social entrepreneurial practice, through sustainable tourism, or Sustainable Social Tourism, considered an innovative model that empowers communities and contributes to peace building. © Common Ground Research Networks, Luz Dary González-Cortés, Soraya Husain-Talero, All Rights Reserved.',\n",

To do so, a descriptive case study is developed applying a valuation method based on an existing model. This way, a maturity level was determined for the studied capacity. This valuation is built with primary information taken from semi-structured interviews to the directors and administrative staff in the health care provider facilities. This information was compared to the policies, strategies, processes, resources and other secondary information provided by the health care provider itself. The results thus obtained show that the innovation capacity in this IPS is heterogeneous as the dimensions thereof are not uniform, and fluctuate between extreme ends. It is due to the fact that the innovation activities in the IPS are processes requiring some formalization and strengthening. Possibly what they need is an innovation management system that enables to prioritize the problems and focus the efforts in specific action lines. © 2019 Pontificia Universidad Javeriana.

Design: Mixed methods research. Method: The study contemplates two components: a quantitative component using a quasi-experimental analytical design before and after longitudinal intervention to determine the effectiveness of the case management model and a qualitative descriptive design to understand the experience of the participants about the model. The Administrative Department of Science, Technology and Innovation of Colombia (Colciencias) funded this project by means of call 777—November 2017, under the financing agreement No. 848—December 2017. Discussion: Addressing problems deriving from the structure of the Colombian healthcare system is crucial for implementing case management models. Furthermore, the effectiveness of such models may be affected by power relations and market failures, but the proved potential of a model may represent a generalized benefit for the Colombian health system. Impact: In Colombia, considering complications and management of chronic non-communicable diseases as isolated cases is considered as the highest cost events in healthcare provision, since an average of 12.8\\xa0million pesos is invested in each patient. This has led to rethink the management in these patients by means of a comprehensive model that guarantees the effectiveness of healthcare delivery, in the framework of a healthcare system heavily affected by payment capacity, where the market has a strong predominance, such as the case of Colombia.

The case that the paper explores focuses on experiential learning and learning in adulthood to design a learning model that considers context and socio-demographic characteristics, makes clear the interconnections between sustainability principles, entrepreneurship rationale and design methodologies and includes actions and processes of reflection and contextual interaction. Design/methodology/approach: Following a recursive argument, the paper applies design research methodology (DRM) to systematically design the “transformative innovation model” that Product Co Creation Centers (PC3) from the University of Twente (The Netherlands) has developed. Findings: Building on Kolb’s cycle of experiential learning, the result of applying DRM is a learning cycle of confrontation, observation, practice and application. The proposed learning model is applied to a specific setting in Colombia, allowing to verify and validate whether the learning model leads to the expected outcomes. It is argued that an interdisciplinary approach, a focus on feedback loops and the consideration of the context are important elements for addressing and transforming complex problems related to sustainable development from the bottom-up.

The research is qualitative, exploratory and uses as an instrument the semistructure interview in thirty companies. The main results indicate that innovation is based on guidelines or technologies for continuous improvement in processes, products and services that are applied as a competitive advantage; framed in external factors to be aware of changes in the environment and take advantage of technological improvements, and internal factors in implementation of open, participatory management, decentralization in decision-making, motivation of staff and commitment to innovation. As important conclusions, it is obtained that, innovation is a competitive advantage that allows the differentiation, and adapt to changes of the environment.

From a business perspective, technology and knowledge are fundamental assets for the growth and sustainability of the organization, being these the pillars on which competitiveness and its differentiation in the market are based. Today, technological development and the creation of new and improved products and services have become drivers for the global economy, whereas emerging as challenges for organizations that must keep pace with the advance of science, technology and innovation if they want to remain in the market being competitive and generating returns (Rios and Marroquín, 2012). Technology transfer strategies then become drivers and generators of knowledge that impact the development of technological capabilities in the company and directly or indirectly promote the growth of a sector of the economy. These types of projects bring with them an effort on the part of the organizations that use personnel, resources and time in a transfer process in search of the increase of their technological capacities and business development. In Colombia, for example, technology-based organizations are companies that usually make use of this type of transfer processes such as licensing agreements, technical assistance and services contracts, mobility of personnel towards other industries, company mergers or acquisitions or intellectual property rights, with the objective of impacting their business growth through the development of new and better products and services for the benefit of their clients, in addition to impacting the country’s industrial development. An example of this is the Corporación de Ciencia y Tecnología para el Desarrollo de la Industria Naval, Marítima y Fluvial—COTECMAR (Science and Technology Corporation for the Development of the Naval, Maritime and Fluvial Industry), which by developing technology transfer projects has achieved the country’s technological independence in terms of the manufacture of ships and naval devices, appropriating technologies and knowledge from shipyards with the most experience in the world.

       " 'In developing countries it is necessary to understand how knowledge transfer (KT) occurs via human capital from universities to regions. This transfer can be viewed as diffusion process and is one essential factor in explaining regional innovation and resulting socioeconomic developments. This phenomenon has been studied at the organizational level, however there are few contributions that consider spreading process models over networks in the macro context. This paper presents a KT model of human capital from university nodes to productive organization nodes for seven Colombian regions, and examines how the proportion of graduates absorbed by each region generates new knowledge products. The phenomenon we consider is based on the susceptible-infected-susceptible (SIS) epidemic process, where the spread parameters are related to the knowledge absorption capacity and the ineffectiveness or unused knowledge of the previous spreading process in the region. In addition, the model tries to explain the dependence of knowledge products (KP) with Science, Technology, Engineering and Math (STEM) graduates and the productive structure complexity. To validate the model, we have used the data of13 consecutive years obtained from the Education Ministry, as well as from the Science and Technology Observatory of Colombia. Our findings reflect that the proposed model explains the KT phenomenon, where each node or region is a heterogeneous node, because they have different absorption and ineffectiveness parameters, as well as, diverse productive structure configurations. © 2018 IEEE.',\n",

Colombia was one of the early adopters in Latin America, having introduced EPR in 2007 to manage several end-of-life products, such as pesticide containers, medicines, lead acid batteries, light bulbs, small batteries, computers, and tires. However, there has been no comprehensive investigation into how EPR has been applied in the context of Colombia. Using the case of end-of-life tires, this study aimed to provide an understanding about two aspects of the EPR system in Colombia: the governance structure and the performance in the end-of-life management. This study found that the Colombian EPR governance model imposes full financial and operational responsibilities on tire producers and importers, while it fails to incentivize other actors in the product chain to carry out their allocated tasks and responsibilities. As for the performance, the EPR system has increased the amount of tires collected over the last five years, but the level is low compared with other developed countries, and more importantly, it does not fully promote the recovery of values from tire waste. The analysis of the current situation in Colombia and lessons from other countries suggest that the effectiveness of the EPR policy would require the establishment of solid, but feasible targets, while allowing flexibility in meeting those targets. It would also benefit from the consideration of economic instruments, as well as establishment of complementary policies to promote innovation and strengthen the regulatory controls over the free riders and management of tire waste. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd',\n",
       " \"In recent years, Corporate Universities have become a critical element in the development of human capital inside companies, institutions and organizations, promoting strategies based on knowledge management as an essential factor to achieve social innovation and sustainable competitive advantages aligned with the strategy. Therefore it is essential for these institutions to reach the highest levels of efficiency and excellence in company processes and structures and to achieve planned corporate goals and objectives. In this work an extensive and thorough review of the current literature was carried out in relation to the concept, in order to analyse the latest trends in Corporate Universities. A comparative evaluation with traditional university aspects was performed, identifying their own differentiators, for example the impact on social innovation, the development of sustainable com- petitive advantages, the influence on the company's internal environment, the importance of cultural and technological factors, and the relationship with the orga- nizations strategy, which are important factors in its successful development and interconnection within the company processes. The information obtained from the aforementioned literature review, in combination with the experience gained by the team of consultants and researchers at the PRIME Business School, Sergio Arboleda University, Bogota, Colombia, allowed to present proposed in general terms a new implementation model of Corporate University. This new model is based on five distinct phases, and with minor adaptations could be to any sector in an organization. The study shows that through this Corporate University model, an organization could gain differentiators to increase social innovation, in time gain sustainable competitive advantages, and a desirable alignment with the objectives and strategic goals of the organization. © Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature 2018.

       " 'The proposal aims to validate an instrument that accounts for the predictors of innovation capabilities in healthcare organizations. Two techniques are accepted, one of them is the Exploratory Factor Analysis (AFE), and the other, the Confirmatory Factor Analysis (AFC). The sample consisted of 200 observations obtained from the network of high complexity hospitals in Colombia during 2016 and 2017. The research shows a valid instrument from its constructs and determinants (Knowledge Management, Human Resource Managament, Organizational Capabilities, Culture, and finally those associated with the Health Care Organizations). Furthermore, the results of the Confirmatory Factorial Analysis allowed to test the theoretical model. This type of initiative is pioneer for three reasons: 1) The application of the methods to the health sector; 2) the conceptual amplitude of a large number of internal predictors of the Innovation Capabilities and 3) the existence of some descriptive studies is detected, with special attention to innovation in a general way, but the intention of the present work goes far beyond the merely prescriptive works, tries to demonstrate by means of quantitative techniques the singularities of innovation capabilities in the health sector. © 2018 Academia Nacional de Medicina.

       " 'In recent years, there has been a change in the topic of protection of the elderly in the world, due to the demographic transition process involving growth in the aging of the population and the foreseeable consequences. This is the reason why there has been a need for a common frame of reference for the welfare, protection and promotion of the rights of the elderly, including the contribution they can make to society, as well as the products and services that they perceive according to the requirements they demand. This article shares some results of the study*, carried out between 2012 and 2015 in two contexts, Colombia and Spain, whose objective was to understand the social reality of a growing market segment and the importance of current government and social policies for the protection and quality of life in senior citizen population. Health deteriorates generally as it advances in age, requiring special attention in the medium and long term, transposed into greater demand for services for the older person. Social economy companies are called to take action on the matter, considering, in truth, of components of the social quadrihelix, composed of: a) academia, through the approach of new professional skills, the exchange of experiences and the promotion of good practices, in addition to research and innovation for the elderly, b) the company, generating or providing appropriate services and products for this population, c) local, regional and national government through the enactment and implementation of the national policy of aging, seeking the protection and defense of the rights of the elderly, and d) the community, through volunteering and the inclusion of the person in conditions of social vulnerability. Thus, the four fronts, imply the commitment that both the citizen and the institutions have to society, in a common work under the same purpose, make visible the degree of corporate and institutional social responsibility and the implementation in benefit of appropriately intervening the situation of old age of population, coordinating and promoting national and international cooperation initiatives that create links with different stakeholders, in order to meet the needs, desires, expectations and tastes, through the quality and relevance of the service perceived by the older person, both in the residences where they live, the products they buy and consume, inside and outside the environment where they reside. The advances of science in recent years has been vertiginous, in a more significant way in medicine and in the new technologies applied to medical science in the pharmacological field, favouring longevity with quality life for the elderly, providing them with the opportunity for more autonomy, physical and mental activity. At the same time, it means that companies and institutions must offer new and better services in accordance with the expectations and needs, not only of the elderly, but also of the family members and administrative staff of the home/residence who need to improve the well-being of the person in charge of, allowing the user to make their own decisions of where to live, what products to consume, which brands and characteristics according to benefits they perceive and require. This is how, from the theoretical review on key conceptions of the elderly**, the demographic trends, the institutional framework of welfare policies in protection and social responsibility that affect the population of the elderly and that could influence health, housing, security and pensions, the variables to be taken into account were defined and three structured surveys and a questionnaire were designed to obtain primary information, highlighting the residences as a starting point and the public involved: seniors, relatives, directors of residential centers and subject matter experts. Allowing to contextualize \"in a general way\" the social welfare, the socioeconomic situation of the elderly population and the social policies that shelter it, as well as the business environment considered a challenge in the population aging process, which goes from managing human talent as a strategic asset in a competitive society until defining and implementing inclusive public policies. Reaching some theories and approaches of entrepreneurship social responsibility and the relationship between business / senior citizens, starting from the liberal relation to the approach of social institutions and thus get to relate some considerations of the residential environment (Colombia-Spain) and quality components of life as a foundation of the social welfare of the elderly as a being of multiple and interdependent needs. Finally, the study shows how, in Spain, in contrast to Colombia, interventions for the benefit of the elderly are notable, from the relationship with workers, volunteers and families. Meanwhile, corporate relations in social management, cooperation and solidarity, are found to be more visible in Spain as a comprehensive strategy and social content, however in both contexts there are gaps in innovation, in processes and products for the activity and physical mobility of this population. In same way, they are also working on the relationship: social responsibility / innovation. In Colombia, some progress has been made, but there is still a lack of promotion, articulation and initiatives of internal and external social responsibility, since there are no clear guidelines in a social responsibility management system that supports initiatives and proposals to manage participation or links with other entities of different sectors. However, in both contexts, it is necessary to coordinate and promote national and international cooperation, which allow the link with different stakeholders, in order to achieve the satisfaction of needs and desires, as well as the quality and relevance of perceived service by the older adult, in the residences and in the external environment where they reside. © 2018 CIRIEC-España.',\n",

       " 'After being known as the ‘murder capital of the world’ in the 1990s, Medellin has pioneered innovative forms of city planning and management and was acclaimed the most innovative city in the world by the Urban Land Institute (ULI) in 2013. Hosting the World Urban Forum in 2014 allowed it to showcase its approach, key elements of which have been: creation of innovative transport infrastructure linking poorer peripheral districts to the city centre; culture-led regeneration; strong support of local development from the local business sector; and a successful municipally-owned utilities company. However, the city is spreading outwards without services and employment being provided; new low-income developments are replicating high-rise models which failed worldwide; there is limited intervention in the existing informal areas, many being in highly vulnerable locations where the level of risk is likely to increase with climate change; development has little regard for topography, ecological and environmental considerations; investment in accessible and good quality public space is restricted to some areas; the quality of the public realm does not always support health and wellbeing of the ageing population. This paper explores the institutional and socio-economic context in which Medellín has achieved the internationally recognized status of an ‘innovative city’. It questions to what extent social equity, environmental sustainability and citizen empowerment have been promoted as per the ULI claims when it conferred the prize. The paper queries the extent to which ‘urban innovation’ is happening in Medellín, which has considerable implications given its recently found role as a ‘model’ city in Latin America and beyond. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd',\n",

       " 'Background and Objective. Seventy percent of the major burn patients have face burns and their surgical management depends on the depth of the burn; usually full thickness burns have to undergo early tangential excision with immediate coverage once the patient is stable and in the partial thickness facial burns the surgical management is dermoabrasion and coverage with topical agents, synthetic dressings or biological dressings. However, the dressing changes with topical agents are painful and frequent procedures and many of the synthetic and biological dressings are expensive and not available for some health systems. The aim of this study was to evaluate the use of amniotic membrane glicerol preserved 85%, as a transient biological dressing in the management of partial and total thickness facial burns. Methods. We developed an observational descriptive prospective study case series of 52 consecutive patients. We used exposed 85% glycerol preserved amniotic membrane as a transient biological coverage provided by the Science, Biotechnology and Innovation District Institute of Health (IDCBIS) of the Health Secretary of Bogotá (Colombia), without secondary dressings, immediately after mechanic dermoabrasion in patients with partial and total thickness facial burns. Results. All the patients epithelialized between the 5th and 10th day with only one application of the amniotic membrane without secondary dressings or topical agents; also the patients did not show wound healing alterations. Some patients stayed in the hospital longer than 10 days because they presented major burns. None of them presented infection and all referred absence of pain during the postoperative period. Conclusions. The use of amniotic membrane as a transient biological dressing for the treatment of partial and total thickness facial burns is an economic, effective and available tool in countries with skin banks. The use of the amniotic membrane after the dermoabrasion avoids daily wound dressing changes, decreases and controls the pain and promotes wound healing and epithelization. © 2018 Sociedad Espanola de Cirugia Plastica Reparadora y Estetica (SECPRE).

       " 'This project was developed by ASOMENORES, a social foundation which aims the resocialisation of criminal Juvenile Offenders’ Law in Bolivar Department in Colombia, in association with the Industrial Design Programme from Jorge Tadeo Lozano University in Bogota, and other stakeholders from the Bolivar region. The main goal of this project was to contribute in social and economic reinsertion of young offenders within society by developing labour and social skills, and, therefore, helping them to improve their livelihood and life quality. The strategy consisted in a participatory design and implementation of the project named \"Popular Design, Productive Chains and Peace Building\" in the municipalities of Cartagena and Turbaco (Bolivar, Colombia). The project envisioned not only teaching to these minors inmates how to build handcrafts, but also included the construction of sustainable productive chains providing great value to their artisanal work. These NEOCraftstrategy (handicrafts renovation movement) included the handmade products transcendence, its environmental responsibility, the use of natural materials and waste management. Therefore, the fundamental value of the craftsmanship lies on its cultural and ancestral tradition that gives uniqueness to the product, separating it from the mass and global consumption of branded products. For ASOMENORES, and for this specific project, the social rehabilitation and reinsertion into society depends on various factors: one of them is the psychological rehabilitation provided by the penitentiary; another factor, the intervention was originated by this project through the construction of productive chains. The strategy was focused on determining skills’ assessment of each participant. From that starting point, the result was the development of individual, technical and competitive advantages. These advantages emphasised over their culture, traditions and perspectives, where was planned to create and innovate with systemic awareness, inclusive and participative added value. It is expecting once the participants are resealed, they will be prepare, with proper tools, to be part of different companies as employees or create their own business. In this way, there is a high probability of decreasing their chances for these young guys to commit an offence again. The innovation of this project lies on the fact that different aspects such as the legal and social components are being intervened from the Design’s Perspective, aimed to achieve institutional changes where all the stakeholders will be benefited from the project, starting with young inmates and their families, and those involved in the training process such as psychologists, teachers and penitentiary guardians, and foremost, the Industrial Design students who managed and experience the development of an educational process from a sustainable productive standpoint. © 2018 Institution of Engineering Designers The Design Society.

       " 'Countries like Japan, South Korea, Israel and Sweden, among others, has proven that the value of a region does not depend solely from natural resources, but intellectual capital is also necessary to create capabilities towards regional development. Bogota, the biggest city of Colombia, concentrates most of the financial and human resources of the country. However, the indexes and measures of regional innovation does not reflect this capability of the city, and most the structures supporting the innovational plans of Bogota are ill implemented or not implemented at all. Even if transform a resources-based economy to a knowledge-based is slow, an appropriate structure and clear roles of the public and private organizations could boost this change. Therefore, this research shows an analysis of the structure of the regional innovation system (RIS), specially focused on information flows, cooperation mechanisms, and collaborative work. Using rigorous organizational cybernetics methods and social network analysis, an initial diagnosis shows that the RIS of Bogota does not connect properly each one of the activities of the system within organizations. Likewise, a lack of communication and control mechanisms result in fragmentation between subsystems and their activities. Based on these results, a proposal for a synergetic network is presented, where resources and activities are tied up. This proposal of public policy shows the advantages of the changes on the relationships between actors, and possible improvement on the communication and control mechanisms. © 2018 Institute of Industrial Engineers (IIE).

A través de una metodología cualitativa basada en el método de análisis documental y utilizando diferentes técnicas de recolección de información, analizamos dos corrientes demográficas que han tenido incidencia en la definición de la economía solidaria en Colombia. La primera es la corriente latinoamericana y la segunda es la corriente de economía social y solidaria. Finalmente hacemos una revisión del marco normativo para proponer algunos elementos teóricos que son la base de la investigación. Este artículo es la realización del primer objetivo específico del proyecto en mención. © 2018 CIRIEC-España.In Colombia, the theoretical and doctrinal origin for the definition and conceptualization of what is understood by solidary economy is not very clear, for this reason we consider the realization of a research project that will lead us to this. The first result is presented in this article. The objective is to present the theoretical reflection that will allow us to have an analysis guide to define the solidarity economy in Colombia. Through a qualitative methodology based on the method of documentary analysis and using different information collection techniques, we analyze two demographic trends that have had an impact on the definition of solidarity economy in Colombia. The first is the Latin American current and the second is the current social and solidarity economy. Finally, we review the regulatory framework to propose some theoretical elements that are the basis of the investigation. This article is the realization of the first specific objective of the project in mention. As results, we find that in Latin America we can mention two currents. The first refers to the ethical- moral current that has as main authors Luis Razeto and Pablo Guerra. The second is the economic current of the solidarity economy with important authors such as José Luis Coraggio, Max Neef and Singer. In Europe, we find a vision called social economy, its main exponents are Jose Luis Monzón and Rafael Chávez in Spain and Jean Luis Laville in France. These definitions allowed us to discuss the denomination used in Colombia and confirm that the term solidarity economy represents in Colombia an important sector that encompasses countless organizations in different parts of the national territory. These organizations are based on collective and community work seeking the solution to specific problems. Solidarity economy is another way of looking at the relationship between economy, human and his context, where he bases his actions on loyalty practices with culture, humanity, territory, in search of a balance between being, having and living. In Colombia, through Law 454 of 1998 two types of organizations are distinguished, those of solidarity economy and solidarity developed, there are organizations of a solidary nature such as cooperatives, employee funds, mutual associations but also We recognize associations, corporations, foundations, volunteer groups, community action boards, among many others that respond to the conceptual and empirical characteristics of the solidarity economy mentioned below. The main conclusions refer to the characteristics of the solidarity economy in Colombia. From the social point of view, the solidarity economy is the means to achieve the social development sought by the territories. From the economic point of view, it is a new rationality of movement, use, accumulation and relationship between the economic factor and being. From the political point of view, self-management seeks the independence of the State in relation to its decisions. However, it is a movement that projects changes within public policy focused on equity between the social, economic, cultural and environmental. From the territorial aspect, it seeks to protect the development of the territory, coexisting with its geographic and cultural context, exploring new rationalities of territory from its socio-economic and cultural practices. From the cultural point of view, it seeks to recognize its origin in solidarity, cooperative and mutualist practices, striving to rescue them again, invigorate them and encourage them from and for the territories with new forms of organization. From the environmental aspect, it seeks the generation of territorial development balanced with the environment and its social context. From the organizational point of view, it is based on the participative, valued activity towards the human being and his capacities, the self-management, the associativity, the solidarity and cooperation are transversal in the organizational structures. From the individual, considers that the person is the end and not a means, take it to their freedoms is one of the purposes so that once free contribute to the overall development of society. Finally, it seeks the participation of the human being as the end of social, political, economic and cultural relations and realities, as a leading actor that seeks continuous but dynamic and changing development, guaranteeing solidarity, cooperative and respectful coexistence with others and their environment. Unlike Latin American countries such as Brazil, Argentina and Uruguay, in Colombia the solidarity economy hardly emerges as an incipient social movement, because it does not have enough identity to give it meaning given the existing heterogeneity and diversity of practices that could be categorized as solidarity economies. The social actors that are participating in the construction of the solidarity economy are varied and diverse; unions, universities, entities of the solidarity economy system, the State, the private sector, the church, international cooperation, organized civil society, popular rural and urban movements, which are called to the strength of the social movement seeking public policies that recognizes the importance of the solidary sector in Colombia. Some Colombian universities have developed since the mid-twentieth century, research programs made up of research groups that have different lines of work related to solidarity economy, as well as formal undergraduate and postgraduate and non-formal teaching programs such as continuing education programs. extension programs that mean work with the community and dissemination actions represented by journals, books, texts and academic events to present research results as well as national university networks (the Unicossol Network Corporation and Ciriec Colombia) related to international networks since decades ago, which have advanced significantly in the construction not only of the concept, but of a culture, movement and social force of the solidarity economy. These networks and research processes allow the solidarity economy to be recognized as a growing sector in the country, with important challenges in terms of the territorial reorganization that Colombia is currently experiencing, as a result of the negotiation processes with the armed groups. The solidarity organizations have emerged and continue to appear as a result of the absence of the State and the urgency of solutions to social problems that have arisen because of the war in Colombia. This particularity in Colombia makes the study of the solidarity economy urgent and necessary in a country where research has been difficult to develop, public investment in rural development processes, access to different territories, among others. Finally, the contribution of this article is based on the effort made by the Unicossol Network in recognizing the solidarity economy as the main source of development in Colombia. The union of researchers from different universities at national level, with different points of view and with experiences in the territory has facilitated the discussion and the approach to the definition of a term little studied in Colombia. © 2018 CIRIEC-España.',\n",

       " 'Agricultural producers grapple with low farm yields and declining ecosystem services within their landscapes. In several instances, agricultural production systems may be considered largely unsustainable in socioeconomic and ecological (resource conservation and use and impact on nature) terms. Novel technological and management options that can serve as vehicles to promote the provision of multiple benefits, including the improvement of smallholder livelihoods, are needed. We call for a paradigm shift to allow designing and implementing agricultural systems that are not only efficient (serving as a means to promote development based on the concept of creating more goods and services while using fewer resources and creating less waste) but can also be considered synergistic (symbiotic relationship between socio-ecological systems) by simultaneously contributing to major objectives of economic, ecological, and social (equity) improvement of agro-ecosystems. These transformations require strategic approaches that are supported by participatory system-level research, experimentation, and innovation. Using data from several studies, we here provide evidence for technological and management options that could be optimized, promoted, and adopted to enable agricultural systems to be efficient, effective, and, indeed, sustainable. Specifically, we present results from a study conducted in Colombia, which demonstrated that, in rice systems, improved water management practices such as AlternateWetting and Drying (AWD) reduce methane emissions (~70%). We also show how women can play a key role in AWD adoption. For livestock systems, we present in vitro evidence showing that the use of alternative feed options such as cassava leaves contributes to livestock feed supplementation and could represent a cost-effective approach for reducing enteric methane emissions (22% to 55%). We argue that to design and benefit from sustainable agricultural systems, there is a need for better targeting of interventions that are co-designed, co-evaluated, and co-promoted, with farmers as allies of transformational change (as done in the climate-smart villages), not as recipients of external knowledge. Moreover, for inclusive sustainability that harnesses existing knowledge and influences decision-making processes across scales, there is a need for constant, efficient, effective, and real trans-disciplinary communication and collaboration. © 2017 by the authors.',\n",

Despite the importance, theoretically given to the TICs, a great gap is found in the scientific literature regarding the measurements of these capabilities in the higher education sector. In this paper, the results of the implementation of a fuzzy inference diagnostic system for organizational capabilities for innovation in a university institution (UI) in the city of Medellin, Colombia are presented. The system consists of the application of a structured diagnostic instrument - type interviewed-to the management and teaching staff of the institution. The data is adapted to the requirements of a fuzzy inference system, in which previously defined variables are related, their values are standardized and entered in an inference system. The values were implemented and processed in the Fuzzy Logic Toolbox - MATLAB. As inference system output, concrete numerical values, and surfaces of fuzzy inference were obtained to formulate organizational strategies aimed at improving the technological innovation capabilities of the institution. © 2017',\n",
       " 'At the end of the first decade of the 21st century, the issues surrounding the quality of water resources are increasingly evident at the global and regional levels. However, under the influence of the environmental reform of the 1990s in Colombia, the institutional framework sought to avoid the threat by leaning towards the decentralized management of sustainability and the application of economic instruments such as the compensatory rate (Pigouvian tax). The purpose of this article is to review the performance of these two standards against the role of civil society in the intervention on water quality in the high basin of the Cauca river. For this, the institutional analysis combined with econometric tools including models with panel, ANOVA and finally main components are used. In the end, the scope of civic citizenship as a complement or alternative to the typical tools of the regionalized public administration is discussed. The results show, among many others, the harmlessness of financial instruments such as compensatory rates to attack water contamination, along with the capacity of social organizations to control associative processes in defense of the river water quality. © 2017 Universidad de Caldas.',\n",

This seems common in third world countries. Intelligent Knowledge based systems (IKBS) have to do with the creation of value from intangible intelligent assets, that are resurrected from amalgams of Artificial Intelligence, Knowledge Engineering (KE), BUSINESS PROCESS REENGINEERING (BPR), Cognitive Systems Engineering, Software Engineering, and Third Millennium organizations, among others. Intelligent behavior requires being able to acquire and manage information, data and knowledge to make effective decisions for organizations to function intelligently in crises. Requires intellectually demanding environments with more open minds. The U. San Jose-FESSANJOSE has developed a supportive environment for decision-making in the complexity of higher education (HE), and a set of planning tools has been designed to deal with the crisis. These tools, are expected to help stakeholders develop and communicate understanding of high priority issues so that smart decisions can be made and implemented during crises in the case of Colombia. After 60 years of war confrontation (civil society, guerrilla, paramilitary) we are preparing toward a post-conflict situation; for labor re-qualification of thousands of victims a new education model based on integrating architectures and knowledge systems is proposed. The post-agreement implies greater social investment especially in education, towards the reconstruction of Peace and Equity that goes beyond social mobility (e.g. employment) with new educational models based on high quality and decentralization. Nowadays the Government of Colombia (GoC) signed an Agreement with the guerilla FARC after 6 years of talks. In the following days the Peace Nobel Prize was granted to the GoC President, Juan M. Santos. The following days new dialogues, with the minor and remaining guerilla ELN, was announced for starting soon in Ecuador. If succeed, the total peace will be warranted. The new educational model, involves: • Individual monitoring and evaluation, • guided by ICT (information and communicationstechnologies), • competencies (supported by KE) • asynchronous methodolyg, • personal tutoring: teaching/automated online (includingmobile devices usage), • for the population of young and adult, victims of armedconflicts, • for people preparation for the IV Industrial Revolution,and to face the transition to the Digital Transformation(to radically improve performance of institutions) Regarding the social situation, in our side we are preparing for a post-conflict situation; we have to prepare thousands of demobilized people and victims, requiring labor re-qualification. In addition, given the deficit of 100,000 ICT Engineers, and 300,000 Technologist (T) and Professional Technicians (PT), e.g. programmers; our proposal is intended as a disruptive innovation to address the post-war digital divide, and this country has based human talent mental rehabilitation, with training and labor requalification. We integrated our own experiences and proposed a new education model, based on the integration into an Intelligent Management Information System (iMIS), of 5 architectures that we previously have implemented in several higher education Institutions (HEI) in Colombia. Those architectures, supported by the convergence of Information, Software, and KE, with Artificial & Computational Intelligence, and guided by mathematical and computational models. iMIS integrates hybrid multilevel architectures with multilevel systems, in order to respond to the solution of HE-ME (middle education) problems, leading to face competitiveness and productivity, observing specifically how to include these technologies for evolving the university into modernity, bringing together the institution governability, the student and teacher productivity, and the High Quality Education (HQE). The paper characterizes an intelligent educational organization of the III millennium, defines post-conflict crises, and discusses a competency-based educational model as part of the alternatives to confront the national crisis with an educational crisis management framework. We are trying to consolidate numerous experiential learnings related to the complexity of HE such as student dropout, educational quality, productivity and competitiveness in an underdeveloped country like Colombia.

       " 'Purpose: This paper aims to explore the relationship between clustering and hotel competitiveness in emerging economy destinations by analyzing potential mediation of the management innovations implemented. Design/methodology/approach: This empirical study is based on hotel-level information from a survey including 131 hotels in 2014. Colombia was chosen as a representative of Colombia, Indonesia, Vietnam, Egypt, Turkey and South Africa (CIVETS) emerging destinations. The relationships were analyzed by structural modeling and partial least squares. Findings: Clustering has a positive direct impact on hotel competitiveness and innovation, and there is a positive effect of innovation on competitiveness. Therefore, the link between clustering and competitiveness is partially mediated through implementation of management innovations. Practical implications: Hotels should actively participate in agglomerated destinations and build relationships with established firms by clustering. Interaction with related firms and implementation of management innovations will lead to increased levels of economic competitiveness. Public policymakers should foster collaborative strategic networking in the hospitality industry of emerging economy destinations. Originality/value: This paper focused on separating the direct and indirect effects of clustering on hotel competitiveness. Implementation of management innovations was considered as an outcome derived from clustering in emerging tourist destinations, using the example of Colombia. Clustering stimulates and eases management innovations within the location, and that combination reinforces the role that cooperating while competing plays in hotel competitiveness for destinations with lagging innovation. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.',\n",

In the methodology, a cluster analysis was performed which identified three groups of companies with similar characteristics: innovators, explorers and stragglers. An analysis of variance (ANOVA) was also performed to establish meaningful differences in the means. The results show that for product ICs there are significant differences in the development of routines aimed at developing environmentally friendly products and improvements in design. Meanwhile, for processing ICs there are significant differences with regard to the incorporation of basic but essential business technologies and the management of interrelated technologies. However, for financial performance differences are significant in terms of sales growth and increased market share. In conclusion, the development of product and process ICs does not guarantee better results in sales growth and market share compared with smaller companies that have made less of an effort to consolidate such routines.

The type of study is descriptive, of a correlational nature, for which information was obtained from 640 managers of the companies mentioned. The results indicate that a low percentage (27%) of companies comprehensively undertakes knowledge management and that from such administration only the activity of using knowledge has a direct and significant relationship with the companies' operative and financial outcome. It is concluded that the practice of knowledge management (KM) refers more to training people, the traditional role of management, than to training for creating knowledge that enables building differentiating capabilities and innovation by the business. This tendency of the analyzed companies to be traditional and conservative hinders their own ability to respond adequately to the challenges of the new increasingly globalized, competitive, changing and uncertain economic order.\",\n",

Develop a model based on a frame logic to quantify SMEs' internationalization by integrating linguistic variables such as human talent, infrastructure, innovation strategies, FTAs, marketing strategy and finance, among others. It is argued that the company management of international markets depends on internal factors, especially the capabilities and resources available, based on the premise that the profits made by a company depend on external factors (competitive environmental features) and internal factors (the integration of resources available), those latter are perhaps this research's biggest challenge, because it is required to propose a suitable battery of capabilities and define their importance and strategic relevance to building competitive advantages. Design/ Methodology/Approach. Fuzzy inference system is proposed to model the resources, skills and competencies that determine internationalisation success. Data: 157 linguistic variables are used, arisen from entrepreneurs, experts, consultants and researchers in international trade, and through expert judgment, 18 factors explaining export capabilities are defined. The proposed model is applied by means of a case study of the textile and clothing cluster in Medellin, Colombia. Findings. In model's implementing it got a particular global index of 28.2 for internationalisation capabilities. The result confirms the hypothesis that the capabilities and resources currently available to the sector analyzed, are not sufficient for a successful integration into the international market, and most importantly, specifies the factors and variables to intervene to improve the export's capability. Limitations. In the particular case of textile companies, is highlighted the lack of a continuous information record and very few studies directed towards the long-term plans development. Similarly, there is little consistency in the exports criteria. Originality/Value.

With this framework is possible to model scenarios about the government as a regulator of Higher Education services, the educational institutions as providers of higher education services and the different business and social sectors, and individual citizens as clients of higher education services. Under this perspective all the stakeholders can participate in the planning, development, transfer, use and control of all the products and services lifecycles of higher education in order to prioritize improvement alternatives and measure progress when it is moving towards excellence in training processes, research, innovation, development and knowledge transfer.

       " 'Constant changes in technology pose continuous challenges for higher education institutions that are training the engineers of the future. These changes are making it necessary to adapt the curriculum in order to develop the skills needed by the XXI century engineer. Moreover, instead of thinking in a large curriculum reform at a specific moment, it is necessary to define curriculum management processes that include change as a natural component of the process. In addition to these global trends, each institution has a particular context and thus, the analysis in each institution has unique characteristics, a common methodological approach, and a reference model that can be built as long as it is flexible enough to include that context. This paper describes a model developed for curriculum management inside the School of Engineering at Universidad EAFIT - Colombia. This model includes the institutional context and is based on a process approach defined by the Business Process Management (BPM) methodology. The model uses the Burlton Hexagon as a theoretical framework to identify organizational structure, strategies, policies, infrastructure, technology tools and human capital. It is also a mechanism for specifying curricular macro processes including the global and institutional context. The proposed model is based on three pillars: (a) scientific research in education, which promotes the use of the scientific method as a strategy to ensure an approach to problems based on evidence which allows the construction of educational innovation projects, (b) education engineering focused on engineering education, which transforms the learning by developing basic, professional, and transversal skills as well as those specific for an engineer of the XXI century, and (c) interactive educational communities, both face to face and virtual, as spaces for knowledge management that support collaborative working and experience-sharing, managed by its members working together promoting initiatives to develop educational innovation projects focused on specific topics, that answer questions related to teaching and learning needs. The formulation and development of educational innovation projects are the responses to different needs identified on specific courses that are transformed into research questions. These projects aim to renew the curriculum so that it dynamically evolves based on classroom experiences. Thus, the curriculum renewal is based on critical thinking about the problems found in engineering education. The use of the scientific method and the collaborative approach enables drawing solid conclusions based on the experimental results. The model proposes the formulation and development of innovative educational projects in which scientific research applied in education aims to transform teaching, academic and administrative practices. As consequence, curricular innovations that integrate learning objects and educational, methodological and assessment strategies, are developed by an interactive learning community composed by teachers. Finally, the results obtained by applying the model in some courses in the School of Engineering of Universidad EAFIT are presented. These results include reducing the drop-out rate of students, redefining admission and graduation profiles, and micro-curricular redesign based on competences using projects, among others. © 2014 IEEE.',\n",
       " 'The aim of the paper is to propose answers to the research question: What are the variables associated with knowledge management, which are conducted by the research groups of higher education institutions -HEI- in Colombia? This problem was identified by analyzing two major tensions. First, between the socially relevant knowledge and knowledge required by the market; and second, between the social research and research oriented by science, technology and innovation. These tensions put the knowledge management, which are conducted by the research groups, at the center of analysis. The methodology used is a case study of a qualitative and descriptive type, for which interviews and analysis of the curriculum vitae of directors and members of research groups were conducted. Review of literature on knowledge management was made, and research done on this topic by HEI. The findings are shown in three groups of variables associated with knowledge management: a) the research structure: planning, resource management, openness to change, leadership, teamwork, initiative, partnership, research training and employment; b) the research process: the problem and research questions, hypotheses, methodology, analysis and interpretation of results, participation in calls, regulation, research platforms and academic production; and c) the innovation process: prospective vision, interaction with the environment, creativity and use of information technologies. The findings indicate that the knowledge management in research groups, should be redirected through institutional policies articulated to the scientific and technological development. Although research groups perform activities resulting from the model of knowledge management (socialization, outsourcing, combination, and internationalization), these are not always practiced in a conscious way; and they also have structural difficulties during the research process, hindering the transfer of knowledge. Taking into account that HEI have integrated management systems that support the research process, it still requires improving the quality of these stages of management. The usefulness of the results leads to rethink policies that guide the processes of institutional research, and redirect knowledge management that is performed from the research groups. This for to move from the structuring of research problems arising from a weak conception of knowledge, to others where sociocultural realities are the benchmark for its formulation. Also aims to consolidate knowledge management from improving academic productivity of research groups, despite the risks of productivism. This is because the productivism is characterized by the proliferation of scientific papers based on the logic of the stacking, but, not of the knowledge creation and its social relevance.. Such practices transformed the publication, which it is a byproduct of the research, in a order of itself.',\n",

This document is the result of the analysis of the signals of the sector, second component of the preliminary stage of the DECK Study carried out by Bio Gerencia Virtual®. The main official sources of the food and beverage industry in Colombia were analyzed to detect the potential of this industry to create value by transforming knowledge into innovation. From analysis of the industry variables, signals that can become the basis for indicators are identified and propose a path of positive development for the sector: Transforming a traditional sector into one driven by knowledge. Peter M. Senge and others have referred to the deep learning cycle as the essence of the learning organization. When major changes are required, a deep learning cycle operates and can happen individually or collectively. In the Paisa Culture Prototype, a prototype of Knowledge Management for Innovation, whose base is the DECK Study, analyzes of specific sectors of the Colombian economy is included. If we understand each sector as a team able to create what it wants to create, the deep learning cycle will be relevant to each economic sector. In particular, the food and beverage industry of Colombia depends largely on the rich biodiversity of Colombia. The greatest opportunities for the sector can be found in the governmental purpose of transforming the Colombian industry. The food sector is at the center of this transformation; but, according to the findings, if the deep learning cycle is not activated, the transformation will not occur; and therefore neither will there be knowledgebased innovation. If the sector does not renew its thought model, it will not become an innovative sector. In the second part of the document, and with the representation of information of the business learning loop proposed by Haeckel and Nolan, work fronts in the sector are derived and some considerations are presented, taking into account issues of learning required to implement a traditional industry to become an innovative industry driven by knowledge.

Most hospitals in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) have not implemented STPs, often because of financial and logistic limitations. We report the impact of an STP designed for the care of trauma patients in the emergency department (ED) at an LMIC hospital on patients with severe traumatic brain injury (STBI). Methods We developed an STP based on generally accepted best practices and damage control resuscitation for a level I trauma centre in Colombia. Without a pre-existing trauma registry, we adapted an administrative electronic database to capture clinical information of adult patients with TBI, a head abbreviated injury score (AIS) ≥3, and who presented ≤ 12 h from injury. Demographics, mechanisms of injury, and injury severity were compared. Primary outcome was in-hospital mortality. Secondary outcomes were Glasgow Coma Score (GCS), length of hospital and ICU stay, and prevalence of ED interventions recommended in the STP. Logistic regression was used to control for potential confounders. Results The pre-STP group was hospitalized between August 2010 and August 2011, the post-STP group between September 2011 and June 2012. There were 108 patients meeting inclusion criteria, 68 pre-STP implementation and 40 post-STP. The pre- and post-STP groups were similar in age (mean 37.1 vs. 38.6, p = 0.644), head AIS (median 4.5 vs. 4.0, p = 0.857), Injury Severity Scale (median 25 vs. 25, p = 0.757), and initial GCS (median 7 vs. 7, p = 0.384). Post-STP in-hospital mortality decreased (38% vs. 18%, p = 0.024), and discharge GCS increased (median 10 vs. 14, p = 0.034). After controlling for potential confounders, odds of in-hospital mortality post-STP compared to pre-STP were 0.248 (95%CI: 0.074-0.838, p = 0.025). Hospital and ICU stay did not significantly change. The use of many ED interventions increased post-STP, including bladder catheterization (49% vs. 73%, p = 0.015), hypertonic saline (38% vs. 63%, p = 0.014), arterial blood gas draws (25% vs. 43%, p = 0.059), and blood transfusions (3% vs. 18%, p = 0.008). Conclusions An STP in an LMIC decreased in-hospital mortality, increased discharge GCS, and increased use of vital ED interventions for patients with STBI. An STP in an LMIC can be implemented and measured without a pre-existing trauma registry. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.',\n",
       " \"Background: Several studies have explored the effect of the presence of medical students on patient satisfaction. However, nearly all of these studies took place in hospitals where medical students had been involved in patient care for many years. Less is known about patients' perceptions of care in a hospital moving toward becoming a teaching facility with undergraduate students. No research has explored patient satisfaction before and after the introduction of medical students. Objective: To assess patient satisfaction as an indicator of quality of care (QoC) from the patients' perspective, before and after the presence of medical students in a general hospital setting. Methods: This observational, cross-sectional study was conducted at Hospital Universitario-Fundación Santa Fe de Bogotá (HU-FSFB) in Bogotá, Colombia. The study had two phases. In 2006, prior to HU-FSBF becoming a teaching hospital, 385 subjects were asked to fill out a closed-question questionnaire addressing patients' satisfaction and perception of QoC provided by attending physicians. During the second period in 2009, 372 patients answered the same questionnaire when medical students were involved in their care. Results: Patients' perceptions of QoC provided by attending physicians improved in five aspects when medical students were present: friendliness (p = 0.003), competence providing medical care (p = 0.049), quality of information provided (p = 0.025), amount of time spent with the patient (p < 0.001) and availability to personally provide care (p < 0.001). Overall patient satisfaction also significantly increased (p < 0.001). Conclusions: The presence of medical students does not negatively affect patients' perceptions of QoC, on the contrary, these results provide evidence of improved patient satisfaction in several aspects of care when medical students were involved. The relevance of this study lies in its unique way of comparing patient satisfaction before and after the introduction of medical students. This setting helps elucidate the real effect of the presence of medical students on patient satisfaction. © 2014 Informa UK Ltd.

       " 'Silvopastoral systems (SPS) enhance milk and meat production and are instrumental for the productive rehabilitation of degraded lands. Intensive silvopastoral systems (ISPS) combine fodder shrubs planted at high densities (&gt;10,000 plants ha-1), trees and pastures. Scaling-up such systems requires incentives to address financial and knowledge barriers. In Colombia, the strategy for scaling-up SPS has combined five elements. First, participatory research on real farms contributed to optimize SPS in different agroecosystems and strengthened a network of pilot farms open to research and peer-to-peer technology transfer. Second, capacity building, training, and outreach activities spread the principles of SPS among farmers, field workers, researchers, extension workers, and policy makers. Third, pilot projects explored the role of incentives such as Payment for Environmental Services (PES), technical assistance, soft loans and bonus prices, in spreading SPS. Fourth, successful pilot projects were instrumental in influencing the livestock sector as well as the public policy agenda. Fifth, currently, large-scale projects aimed at mainstreaming SPS are applying the lessons learned in order to achieve landscape-scale benefits, enhance climate change adaptation and mitigation, and introduce SPS products to green markets. Recently, innovation networks have contributed to speed up the adaptation of SPS in different environmental and socioeconomic contexts. © 2013 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.',\n",

       " \"Knowledge about the extent of irrigated land in Colombia is scarce because most irrigation is done informally and therefore not registered. Informal irrigation in Colombia has not been investigated, its national presence has not been identified, and its characteristics are still unknown. The present article aims to help fill this gap. Because of topographical and agricultural patterns, Andean informal irrigation is impossible to identify or characterize using standard methods. To provide information on the scale of informal irrigation systems in Colombia, their type, the users they serve, and the type of water sources they use, a large-scale partial inventory was made combining statistical analysis, questionnaires, interviews, and field trips. The findings indicate that informal irrigation is widespread in the country's mountainous zones, in a great diversity of environments, characterized by an equally great diversity of local uses and water-use strategies. This diversity has resulted from the coexistence of very different community and state institutions, posing challenges for planning and organizing water-resource management more efficiently and sustainably for producers, the government, and other stakeholders.\",\n",
       " \"Introduction: Few studies have assessed the nature and quality of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC). Methods and Findings: The aims of this systematic review are to evaluate the characteristics (including the risk of bias assessment) of RCT conducted in LAC according to funding source. A review of RCTs published in 2010 in which the author's affiliation was from LAC was performed in PubMed and LILACS. Two reviewers independently extracted data and assessed the risk of bias. The primary outcomes were risk of bias assessment and funding source. A total of 1,695 references were found in PubMed and LILACS databases, of which 526 were RCTs (N = 73.513 participants). English was the dominant publication language (93%) and most of the RCTs were published in non-LAC journals (84.2%). Only five of the 19 identified countries accounted for nearly 95% of all RCTs conducted in the region (Brazil 70.9%, Mexico 10.1%, Argentina 5.9%, Colombia 3.8%, and Chile 3.4%). Few RCTs covered priority areas related with Millennium Development Goals like maternal health (6.7%) or high priority infectious diseases (3.8%). Regarding children, 3.6% and 0.4% RCT evaluated nutrition and diarrhea interventions respectively but none pneumonia. As a comparison, aesthetic and sport related interventions account for 4.6% of all trials. A random sample of RCTs (n = 358) was assessed for funding source: exclusively public (33.8%); private (e.g. pharmaceutical company) (15.3%); other (e.g. mixed, NGO) (15.1%); no funding (35.8%). Overall assessments for risk of bias showed no statistically significant differences between RCTs and type of funding source. Statistically significant differences favoring private and others type of funding was found when assessing trial registration and conflict of interest reporting. Conclusion: Findings of this study could be used to provide more direction for future research to facilitate innovation, improve health outcomes or address priority health problems. © 2013 Reveiz et al.\",\n",

       " 'Purpose: The aim of this paper is to empirically test the degree of influence of different knowledge sharing mechanisms (ICT-based, personal interaction-based, and embedded in management processes) on innovation capability (both on ideation and on innovation project management), as well as the influence of each first-level innovation capacity on company performance. Design/methodology/approach: A questionnaire was designed and addressed to the CEOs of the companies making up the target population (Spanish and Colombian medium-high and high technology firms with more than 50 employees and R&D activities). Structural equation modelling (SEM) based on partial least squares (PLS) was then applied to test the hypotheses drawn from the research. Findings: The results obtained show that knowledge sharing is a key issue in order to enhance innovation capability. With the exception of ICT-based knowledge sharing mechanisms (whose influence on the generation of new ideas is not statistically significant), all types of mechanism considered exert a significant impact both on ideation and on innovation project management (although their degree of relevance varies), and account for a great deal of variance in both constructs. Differences between countries arise when it comes to the influence of each first-level innovation capacity on company performance. Research limitations/implications: Traditional limitations of cross-sectional studies apply. Originality/value: The main contribution of this paper is to provide empirical evidence about the impact of knowledge sharing on innovation. Moreover, it reveals what the most effective knowledge sharing mechanisms are for this purpose and provide companies with a basic framework in order to shape their knowledge management strategies in this domain. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.',\n",

This is pursued by means of Innovation Indices, from which it is sought to identify regional and national special features, while allowing international comparative analysis, along the lines of the Oslo Manual. The work highlights the limitations of the information available to carry out the calculation of innovation indices as proposed in the recent literature on the subject. As an alternative, a methodology based on the Importance Value Indices (IVIs) is applied, which allows the calculation of new innovation performance indicators amenable to international comparisons. By applying multivariate statistical techniques, redundant information of a high number of variables is cleared to construct the IVIs; then, clustering and characterization of the different units of analysis is performed using a model that connects the variables refined.

The city government has also established an insurance programme for buildings that provides coverage for low-income households. The paper further describes and discusses the experiences of other city governments, including those of Santa Fe in Argentina and Medellín in Colombia.

       " 'Spatial distribution of sand bodies with the capacity of storing hydrocarbons follows complex patterns in reservoirs deposited in fluvial environments. Understanding this distribution is one of the most important factors to consider in the planning and management of any development strategy. Usually, a vertical distribution of the sand bodies is obtained from well logs, core description, and outcrops added with sedimentation and depositional modeling using different techniques. This information is transferred to 2D and 3D stratigraphic models in correlations and stratigraphic panels. Despite of model depuration and tuning with development information, uncertainty is still very high. The acquisition of 3D multi-component seismic information was defined as the tool to reduce this uncertainty in the volumetric distribution of sand bodies and their connectivity, to build the geometry of the reflectors with the wave field P, identifying the lithology and the presence of fluids. A pilot of this technology was designed in the Tenerife field (Middle Magdalena Valley Basin, Colombia) focused in obtaining information of the Mugrosa formation, of Oligocene age, composed basically by sandstone deposited in thin fluvial channels, primarily meandering. To obtain the planned outcome, a high density design (480,000 traces / km2) was developed to allow a sufficient relation signal/noise in the S wave. Non conventional field tests allowed the design of the parameters of charge from the energy source and the depth of the receptors. For the static solutions, multi-component \"upholes\" and the description of the shot point (SP) where tested to allow a geological model of the strata that could be related with the velocities of the P wave and S wave. The innovative design for the management of the combination of seismic attributes of the S wave and P wave has shown considerable advantages in the definition of the sand bodies in fluvial environments as heterogeneous as this case. This innovation opens immense possibilities for the development of similar fields in the Middle Magdalena Valley Basin as in other regions of the world with similar deposits.

This paper essays an approach to the impact that the strategies of the model of science, technology and innovation on the research activity in humanistic and social areas, in the frame of knowledge management. It will begin by taking into account critical theory and its conception of instrumental rationality, which will allow to show the problems that this kind of rationality poses to research in human and social sciences. The methodology of this research is qualitative and exploratory, developed through interviews directed to researchers in this area of knowledge, responsible for administration and management, to those who design the policies of public and private universities, and to governmental organizations. These interviews pretend to show their appreciations on the impact that these new policies and management strategies will have on human and social sciences. One of the conclusions of these study is that the new model of innovation, called triple helix, pretends that universities lead initiatives and finance the creation of technology based companies.

       " \"Current tendencies in strengthening intellectual property rights and the emergence of new scientific-technological fields (such as nanotechnologies, biotechnology, telematics and software development) have forced universities to acquire sufficient knowledge aimed at protecting their research results and fulfilling a leadership role within their regional settings so that they may generate competitive innovation strategies in alliance with other social agents. However, universities must promote ethical values, respectting and defending their countries' ecological and cultural heritage when intellectual property rights are being promoted. A model for managing universities' industrial property rights is thus proposed here; it is centred on patents so as to improve strategies contributing towards Latin-American universities' scientific and technological development and thereby contribute towards their countries' development. The model is one of the relevant results derived from the theoretical framework for research carried out by the team from 2003-2007 and from the empirical study carried out in two phases. The first phase consisted of a survey whose objective was to detect critical aspects regarding managing patents and licenses for universities in Colombia, Chile and Spain. The second empirical phase consisted of holding in-depth interviews with those managing the patents for the universities having the best performance in the three aforementioned countries. © 2010.\",\n",

       " 'Colombia is the second largest world flower exporter. This leadership was achieved in part by the adaptation of imported technology. However, the special conditions of the production areas particular to the high tropics and increased international pressure require that the producers combine their efforts to increase productivity and competitiveness. To meet this challenge, the Colombian Association of Flower Exporters (Asocolflores) recently established the Colombian Centre for Innovation in Floriculture (Ceniflores) as a scientific, technological, independent, private, and non-profit institution. Research investment is long term and has proven high rates of return in other commodities. Due to limited funding, the flower sector needs adequate tools to manage it strategically. A research plan based on grower demand is the starting point for the Centre, which acts as \"virtual\" articulator between producers and research institutions, nationally and abroad. To achieve its objectives, Ceniflores has acquired a systems infrastructure built completely on Internet through a WEB-based architecture. This allows for information collection from multiple sources, its integration, and analysis. The information is available to different stakeholders through articulated networks (Business Web [B-Web]) built around the services offered, including access to documents, projects, research priority questionnaires, databases, and topic-based research networks, among others. The technology used is based on various open source applications, dramatically reducing time and cost to implement each of the services. Furthermore, the use of existing applications and how they have been integrated, allow replication of the model by other centres that require the creation of WEB based networks.',\n",

       " \"Objectives Designing and proposing alternative models for municipal and Departmental malaria control programmes based on evidence obtained concerning the process of malaria on the Colombian Pacific Coast and regarding key problems in the malaria control programme before and following health system reform in 1993. Methods An evaluative study was carried out, comparing the situation before and following the 1993 reform; model design was also compared. Control programme is understood as being the institution, the human group and administration in charge of control activities. The study was carried out in 2002 and 2003, in the Departments along the Colombian Pacific Coast; the four departmental capitals, 28 malarial and 5 control municipalities were included primary and secondary information was obtained by means of surveys and semi-structured interviews, community meetings and reviewing documentation in the secretariats of health, the Vector-borne disease control programme-VBDC, the Expanded Immunisation Programme-EIP, Health Promoting Entities-HPE, Subsidised Regime Administrators-SRA and Service-Providing Entities-SPE. Results The following results were obtained: 1. Illustrating and analysing malarial tendencies in the country and on the Pacific Coast, and the corresponding institutional transformations in the programme; 2. Characterising the control programme which existed before 1993; 3. Characterising departmental modes of decentralising the programme; 4. Identifying the effects of reforming the system and characterising control programme problems; 5. Comparing the programme with the Expanded Immunisation Programme (EIP); 6. Comparative analysis of the programme and identifying current gaps in management capability; 7. Actors' perceptions regarding the control programme; 8. Values and challenges for an innovative control programme; and 9. Designing a model for up-dating/adapting the control programme. Discussion Malaria control programmes' problems and weaknesses are frequently and inarticulately attributed to the lack of knowledge and management skill of personnel working in such programmes, the lack of an information and communication system or weaknesses in the municipalities or personnel. These factors may well have had an effect; however, a global and institutional approach leads to locating the programmes within a social, political and cultural context. This allows interpreting control programmes' current problems, amidst decentralisation and reform processes, and linking this interpretation to modelling and opening a space for innovation in such programmes. The study's main limitations spring from particularities regarding Pacific Coast control programmes and weakness in health information systems.\",\n",
       " 'Colombia is a poor country that has been plagued by ongoing violence for more than 120 years. During the 1940s, subversive terrorist groups emerged in rural areas of the country when criminal groups came under the influence of Communism, and were later transformed into contemporary groups, such as the Ejercito de Liberacion Nacional (ELN) or National Liberation Army and Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionares de Colombia (FARC) or Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia). Paramilitary terrorist groups emerged in response to subversive groups and were later transformed into contemporary groups, such as the Autodefensas Unidas de Colombia (AUC) or United Self-Defense Forces of Colombia. Terrorism has placed an enormous burden on modern Colombia. From 1995 to 2002, 9,435 people were killed by terrorism-related events, of which 5,864 were killed by subversive terrorist activities and 3,571 were killed by paramilitary terrorist activities. In 2002, at least nineteen attacks produced 10 or more casualties, of which 18 were bombings. In 2002, terrorists killed at least 12 mayors, 71 legislators, and internally displaced 300,000 persons from their homes. Since terrorist groups in Colombia are typically supported by drug manufacturing and trafficking, it has been difficult at times to distinguish violence due to terrorism from violence due to illicit drug trafficking. Terrorism has also had a major adverse effect on the economy, with restricted travel, loss of economic resources, and lack of economic investment. In addition to political, military, and commercial targets, terrorists have specifically targeted healthcare infrastructure and personnel. At the national and local levels, much emergency planning and preparedness has taken place for terrorism-related events. The Centro Regulador de Urgencias (CRU) or Emergency Regulation Center in Bogota plays a major role in coordinating local prehospital and hospital emergency response in the capital city and the national level where necessary. © World Association for Disaster and Emergency Medicine 2003.',\n",

The steady dynamics of science, technology and innovation plus the volume of information that these subjects have, represent a challenge to the research groups endeavor and to the commitment of the later ones to be knowledge developing units that give significant outputs to its social and academic settings. Therefore, there must be a planning alternative that supports the decisionmaking processes in order to give it a better knowledge founding, to reduce the possible risks and to think ahead the possible changes. This alternative must be supportedby an organized, selective and systematic procedure, such as the technological surveillance. Objective. To create a descriptive literature review regarding technological surveillance and a proposal for the technological surveillance method applied to the management of scientific activity of the Estudio Genetico de Enfermedades Complejas (EGEC – Genetic Study for Complex Diseases) research group. Methodology. Descriptive literature review. The following academic databases were consulted: Medline, SciELO, Ebsco e IEEE and Google Scholar search engine. The combination of keywords used when consulting the academic databases, was “vigilancia tecnológica/technological surveillance”, “salud/health”, “enfermedad/disease”, “ejemplos en salud”, “universidad” and “investigación”. Articles of the last five years are included, while articles that only had to deal with the results dissemination of technological surveillance exercises, were excluded. Based on the literature review analysis of results, a technological surveillance model is proposed which its objective is to manage the EGEC research group’s scientific activities. In order to do so, a stages, inputs and funds diagrams that integrated the surveillance model, were created. Thus, the already mentioned diagrams included a cancer pilot test as a validation strategy, and with the test results, the model was subjected to additional adjustments.Results. The Spanish standard UNE 166006:2011 created by the Spanish Association for Standarization and Certification (AENOR), was taken as an international reference whilst the program España y sus Regiones Intercambian Conocimiento con Antioquia (ERICA) and the methodology for technological surveillance Innovaciones a partir de la Vigilancia Tecnológica (InnoViTech), were taken as national referents. Additionally, conceptual stages, good practices for processes execution and defined budget for the development of technological surveillance, are established. The main components for the proposed model include needs identification, plus the planning, collection, auditing, analysis, documentation, and information spreading processes. Conclusions. The proposed model works as a foundation for developing a knowledge management strategy of a research group. Also, the model highlights the importance of climbing towards the usage of competitive intelligence systems within itself. [CarrilloZambrano E, Páez-Leal MC, Suárez JM, Luna-González ML.

       " 'The main aim of this paper is to establish the hidden incidences that can improve specific aspects of beekeeper Small and Medium Enterprises (SME) innovation capabilities in Boyacá-Colombia. The methodology is focused on the use of the expertons model, adequacy coefficient and forgotten effects theory. A questionnaire of 58 items about different innovation management areas is distributed to 14 beekeeper SMEs in the area of Boyacá-Colombia. The findings suggest that there are two specific actions that can improve innovation culture. These actions are related to marketing strategies and product innovation. The innovation strategy has a significant influence on the development of an innovative culture in the beekeeper SMEs; one must have a clear orientation to the innovation objectives in the marketing strategy, which is transferred to the product. Likewise, the utility of fuzzy methods for analysis when information is limited, subjective and scarce is highlighted. Finally, this research can be useful to practitioners and academics because the findings can serve as guidelines to understanding sources and enablers of innovation. In addition, the findings show how fuzzy methods help in contending with incomplete and subjective information, highlighting the meaning of the information rather than its measurement. © 2021, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.',\n",
       " 'Cooperatives with financial activity stimulate the economy by providing economic resources to individuals and companies that cannot access the banking sector or prefer to belong to the cooperative sector. The objective is to analyze the economic and social impact of these cooperatives in the cities of Montería and Ibagué, Colombia, considering their determining attributes. The study is descriptive with a quantitative approach and 32 financial cooperatives participated. A questionnaire validated by expert judgment and a Cronbach’s Alpha coefficient of 0.815. The results show that the type of user, contracting modality, product offering, surplus growth, investments and advertising strategies, are some of the determining attributes in the management of the cooperatives with financial activity. It is concluded that these entities have an economic and social impact that is reflected in the quality of life of their associates, their families and their environment. Investing in technology and innovation is recommended to meet current and future challenges facing the cooperative sector. © 2021, Universidad del Zulia. All rights reserved.',\n",
       " 'Achieving multi-million-hectare commitments from countries around the world to restore degraded lands in resilient and sustainable ways requires, among other things, huge volumes of tree planting material. Seed systems encompassing all forest reproductive material (e.g., seeds, cuttings, stakes, and wildings), are key to ensuring that sufficient planting material with a diverse range of suitable species, adapted to local conditions and capable of persisting under a changing climate, is available for restoration projects. The ideal structure of a seed system integrates five components: seed selection and innovation, seed harvesting and production, market access, supply and demand, quality control, and an enabling environment. We propose 15 indicators to evaluate these key components and trial them by assessing national seed systems in 7 Latin American countries. We conclude that the indicators enable a straightforward assessment of the strengths and weaknesses of national seed systems, thus assisting governments to identify key areas for improvement and opportunities for horizontal learning. © 2021 by the authors.

       " 'It is widely recognized that the design and application of suitable and robust science, technology and innovation (STI) policies and appropriate STI institutions promote development, economic growth and competitiveness in the long run. This paper analyses the dynamics of STI in Colombia over the 1995–2019 period to determine its relationship with its most important determinants and its collateral relationship with economic growth as an input affecting different issues; this work takes into account the creation of the new ministry of science, technology and innovation (MSTI) and uses different time series techniques. According to the analysis, a positive relationship exists between investments in research and development, STI activities, and the independence and transparency of STI management by the new MSTI, which could generate higher productivity, technological change, economic growth and development. The results of the models also demonstrate the long-run relationship and short-run dynamics related to STI investment and research results and the importance of transparency and independence. It is important to establish adequate STI governance and allow new ministries to play an important role to achieve a society based on knowledge that produces relevant research, technology and innovation based on the needs and resources of the country. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.',\n",

       " \"In 2018, the Colombian Ministry of Health and Social Protection, in collaboration with the National Health Institute and the Pan American Health Organization, convened all actors associated with the National Tuberculosis Prevention and Control Program (PNPCT) and the National Science, Technology, and Innovation System to form a national network to coordinate operations research on tuberculosis (TB) in the country. Seven workshops were held and a consensus was reached to establish the National Network for Knowledge Management, Research, and Innovation in Tuberculosis in Colombia (TB Colombia Network). With more than 180 participants, a central node, and five regional nodes that bring together the country's 37 territorial entities, the TB Colombia Network conducted four days of training in operations research in 2019, defining 65 priority research topics aligned with the strategic lines in the PNPCT: prevention and comprehensive care, with a focus on people affected by TB (41 topics in three modules); and political commitment, social protection, and support systems (24 topics in four modules). The peer comparison method was used for prioritization. The TB Colombia Network remains active and contributes to knowledge management aimed at eliminating TB in Colombia. It has helped make progress in building plans and implementing local operations research projects that generate scientifically validated results to strengthen the PNPCT and improve the care of TB patients. © 2021 Pan American Health Organization.

       " 'Scientific capabilities are a concept subordinated to the productivity metrics of classical scientometrics. This has generated a series of management and evaluation processes of university scientific activity that constrain the understanding of the capacities generated by the institutions themselves. Even in the application of their instruments and policy models, productivity plateaus are achieved that raise questions about the possibility of sustainability and governance of these capacities. The chapter proposes a redefinition of the notion of science, technology, and innovation (STI) capabilities that go beyond the comparison of the relative competitive weight or value of one group with respect to another, but rather in terms of the heterogeneity between types of scientific and technological activity that universities carry out. For this purpose, we conceptualize the university as a complex adaptive system (CAS) in order to propose a methodology for evaluating the expected or planned results in the three missions—training, research, and extension—, in terms of the activation of governance mechanisms. In this context, this chapter focuses, exemplifies, and learns from the analysis and experience of modeling the STI capabilities of the Universidad del Valle de Colombia, through which we offer an alternative to strengthening the governance and management of the university mission. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.',\n",
       " 'This chapter proposes the concept of Community-Based Innovation Ecosystem, as a framework for analysing communal and transformative innovation processes, particularly in territories affected by armed and social conflicts. In this way, it questions the conventional notion of innovation as a transactional process to open new markets in capitalism, towards a re-signified notion, as a sociotechnical process of collective transformation linked to actions carried out by grassroots organizations and communities. Therefore, the ecology of innovation is used as a biological metaphor for the studies of management and innovation. The case of the Guajuí River Community Council in Guapi—Colombia is described and analysed through the relationships between diverse, historically excluded actors through collaboration in post-conflict or post-agreement contexts. Finally, a series of conclusions are presented regarding the interdependent dynamics of the actors in Guapi, their limitations, opportunities, and future lines of action. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.',\n",
       " 'Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to examine the enablers and barriers influencing international knowledge transfer at the team-level in the context of product innovation within an emerging-market multinational enterprise (EMNE) in the insurance industry. Design/methodology/approach: The research applies an exploratory case study design considering an emerging-market multinational insurance company headquartered in Colombia. Four subsidiaries (El Salvador, Chile, Argentina and Colombia) and the Corporate Office (headquarter) served as the research sites. It also adopts an interpretive research approach providing a grounded theory framework linking international knowledge transfer and product innovation. Findings: The empirical findings emphasize the central role played by the enablers (i.e. shared vision, empathy and knowledge sources) in facilitating international knowledge transfer, which, in turn, enhances product innovation. More important, however, is the detailed explanation that the paper provides regarding the enablers’ microfoundational antecedents in terms of key activities that are performed at the team-level. Research limitations/implications: The grounded theory framework was constructed using data collected in a single firm associated with a particular industry and regional context. The study only considered a single aspect of knowledge management (i.e. knowledge transfer). Other aspects of knowledge management systems, such as knowledge creation and knowledge application, should be used for explaining product innovation in EMNEs more comprehensively. Practical implications: The study suggests a set of enabling conditions and activities that should be adopted by managers of EMNEs to improve international knowledge transfer with the aim of triggering product innovation. This includes the design of strategies for strengthening empathy among geographically dispersed teams by providing opportunities for regular live videoconferences among team members aimed at building close bonds, fostering trust and creating a sense of belonging in which participants get to know each other better and to establish a shared vision and a set of guiding principles and commitments for how the team will work. These suggestions are particularly important today when several multinational enterprises (MNEs) have been forced to rearrange their workplace by replacing face-to-face interactions with virtual work dynamics due to the COVID-19 crisis. Originality/value: Previous studies have confirmed that international knowledge transfer positively influences MNEs’ innovative performance. However, no studies have been conducted linking both variables in the context of EMNEs in Latin America in the service sector. The research tries to fill this gap. Besides, the paper introduces empathy as a novel enabler for international knowledge transfer and a moderator able to diminish the negative effect that cultural differences and geographical barriers have on the knowledge transfer process. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.',\n",

       " 'Grassroots innovation generates possibilities for the informal and collective production of the territory that the city itself denies, from bottom-up solutions for sustainable development and consumption, which respond to the local situation, interests, and values of the communities involved. This paper aims to identify how grassroots innovation practices take place and are shaped in ‘El Faro’, a self-built settlement at the urban border of the city of Medellín; and how these have allowed the social transformation of health and well-being. This was done from a qualitative approach with an interpretative scope, under the case study methodology. ‘El Faro’ is a space built by its inhabitants, in a process that they have called \"dignity and resistance\", becoming the promoter of what we identify as four ‘grassroots innovation practices’ developed around three main issues: community water management, artistic training and the creation of community public spaces. This process has allowed them, from the capacity of agency, to understand their poverty situation and face it, modifying the conditions that reproduce it and responding to unsatisfied basic needs, based on innovative solutions that guarantee conditions of life with dignity and well-being. Likewise, it generates mechanisms that reduce inequality because the community becomes the main driving agent for the construction of the city and the transformation of the health-disease process, through its community assets. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd',\n",

       " \"Purpose: This study provides empirical evidence on the innovations that Nonprofit Organizations (NPOs) in Colombia have implemented within their own management to address social problems which are the object of their institutional mission. Design/methodology: This research is based on information obtained from a survey applied to executives of Colombian NPOs. Multiple linear regression models were developed to check the partial effect of the set of independent variables (Organizational and Social Innovation) over the dependent variable (Organizational Performance). Main Components Analysis was applied to grouping the considered variables. Findings: Empirical evidence indicates that Colombian NPOs are innovative organizations that advisedly follow management strategies for this purpose. Colombian NPOs have been innovating for their disposition to tackle the social problems implicated in their institutional mission. Evidence indicates that the main components derived from NPOs' organizational and social innovations are grouped into four: NPO innovation actions to adapt to the environment; internal innovation actions to improve NPO's performance; variables related with NPO innovation actions to improve their relations with external agents; innovation actions aimed at improving the management of social interventions associated with the mission of the NPOs and the management of institutional projects. Research limitations/implications: The field work only used the survey technique to obtain the information and only assessed the perception of one of the directors of each of the NPOs participating in the study in terms of both the actions of organizational innovation such as social innovation and organizational performance. Therefore, the study undoubtedly presents bias in that perception. The technique used for the selection of the sample of the participants was a non-probabilistic sampling, which implies bias in the information and therefore, limitation for the generalization of the results to other contexts. The geographical location of the administration of the NPOs was restricted to Bogota and surrounding municipalities. Originality/value: An analysis of the relationship between social and organizational innovations with organizational performance in NPOs was carried out in the context of an emerging economy, where the subject has been very little studied and much less with principal component analysis. This in order to contribute to a better understanding of the subject. © 2021. All Rights Reserved.\",\n",
       " \"Purpose: This paper investigates the impact of adopting quality management standards like ISO9001 on a firm's performance and the mediator role of human capabilities within firms in this relationship. The article analyses this mediator effect in the context of an emerging economy that set a policy reform aimed at increase ISO adoption and with a large share of informal labour markets. Design/methodology/approach: This study implements a quantitative approach, applying a Difference in Differences-DiD model with a Propensity Score Matching on fixed effect panel data analysis of a sample of certified and non-certified firms using firm-level data obtained from the national statistics office of Colombia. This methodology allows having comparable groups before the policy implementation. It reduces differences in observable characteristics and controls for parallel trends in primary outcomes before the policy reform. Findings: The research findings suggest that after Colombian policy reform of the quality system (2006), firms that adopted ISO 9001 certification increased innovation (5.2%), labour productivity (4.6%), sales (5.7%) and wages (4.9%). Furthermore, it shows that the share of permanent workers is an essential mediator in adopting quality programs. Adopters firms with a large percentage of temporary workers weaken their initial investment in quality infrastructure. Research limitations/implications: This research does not consider one key aspect. This is the lack of information about the organizational culture inside Colombian organizations that is related to a successful implementation of Quality Management standards like ISO 9001. However, it does not affect the conclusion about the mediation effect of human capital in the relationship between ISO 9001 and firm performance. Practical implications: The study covered all the Colombian manufacturing firms with ten or more employees. It provides critical insight for managers to value implementing ISO 9001 certification and appropriately put attention to enhancing their firms' human capital in emerging economies. Also, a policy implication of the paper is that governmental efforts to strengthen quality infrastructure in emerging economies should also include steps to increase a firm's investment in human capital. Originality/value: This study provides further support for government policies to strengthen firms' incentives to adopt modern management practices. The strong effects of implementing these management practices on sales, productivity and innovation have been identified. Furthermore, the investments in quality infrastructure must be accompanied by investment in human capital and workforce stability. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.\",\n",
       " 'Introduction. Surgical management of chest wall lesions with resection and reconstruction with prosthetic material has been increasing, due to advances in surgical techniques and surgeon’s experience, as well as innovation and characteristics of prosthetic materials. They allow wide resections of the wall, guaranteeing greater skeletal stability, less alteration of respiratory mechanics, and better aesthetic results. Methods. The experience in the CardioVID clinic, Medellín, Colombia, between the years 2015 and 2019, is presented through a retrospective review of eight cases that underwent resection of benign lesions of the chest wall and reconstruction with prosthetic material. Results. An adequate evolution of the patients was found, with a good aesthetic and functional result, with adequate control of the disease, without reports of complications or recurrence in follow-up. Discussion. An adequate technique allows the reconstruction of these defects with minimal complications and low prosthesis extraction rates, ending with excellent functional and cosmetic results. With our experience, we can conclude that the proper choice of patients who are good candidates for surgical management, a good surgical technique, and an experienced staff are crucial to achieve good results in terms of lung function and aesthetics results, in addition to obtain survival under the established parameters after achieving an R0 resection. © 2021, Asociacion Colombiana de Cirugia.

Through the means of community identified problems, its main goal was to promote community associative capabilities and socioenvironmental appropriation of territories in order to generate alternative methods of sustainable and sustained development. Methods such as People-centered design, Participatory Action Research and Environmental Education were applied. Results showed that social actors managed to devise, drive and deliver innovative and feasible solutions which made it possible to contribute to the objective of sustainable development and overall pollution reduction in the area. The design applied herein allowed for a collective vision to be built in order to direct community potentials and propose new forms of governance, in relevant elements of economic, social and environmental development of the rural sector. The study concludes that community efforts and their organizational capacity permitted the implementation of a social innovation model focused around the use of solid waste. This model can be replicated in rural areas at the national level, thus contributing towards the mitigation of adverse effects related to anthropic activities. Finally, community actions can influence public policies and participate in the overall transformation of local environment and territories. © 2021, CEDDAR. All rights reserved.',\n",

Endogenous growth and integrationist organizational culture were the theoretical approaches followed by this study. The methodology was de-veloped in two stages: first, the relationship between innovation, human capital and production level was addressed from a longitudinal statistical analysis of the Survey of Technological Development and Innovation in the Manufacturing Industry; afterward, involvement and adaptability factors of the Denison Model were measured through the direct application of a survey to companies in the plastics sector. We found that the impact of staff skills on production is significant and that such impact increases when observing staff with higher education attainment. Besides, involvement and adaptability factors were located in intermediate areas in which the efficient use of production resources is moderate. © 2021, Universidad Nacional de Colombia.

Several management and technological options with enteric methane mitigation potential have been evaluated and their scaling is anticipated to contribute toward achieving GHG emission reduction targets in the framework of the Paris Agreement. Yet, widespread adoption of promising mitigation options remains limited, raising questions as to whether envisaged emission reduction targets are achievable. Using findings from local studies, we explore the mitigation potentials of technologies and management practices currently proposed to mitigate enteric methane emissions from cattle production systems in the higher emitting countries of Latin America. We then discuss barriers for adopting innovations that significantly reduce cattle-based enteric methane emissions and the major shifts in policy and practice that are needed to raise national ambitions in the high emitting countries. Using the latest science and current thinking, we provide our perspective on an inclusive approach and re-imagine how the academic, research, business and public policy sectors can support and incentivize the changes needed to raise the level of ambition and achieve sustainable development goals (SDG), considering actions from the farm to the national scale. © Copyright © 2020 Arango, Ruden, Martinez-Baron, Loboguerrero, Berndt, Chacón, Torres, Oyhantcabal, Gomez, Ricci, Ku-Vera, Burkart, Moorby and Chirinda.',\n",

Knowledge of cocoa crop management practices takes an essential role in the producers’ resilience capacity to face and adapt to changing environments in the productive, social and environmental level. It was carried out a study in the Macarena-Guaviare region, Colombia to evaluate the level of knowledge of cocoa producers, to analyze how this knowledge is affected by familiar, organizational or productive variables, and to determine the formation needs. To determine the level of knowledge, it was proposed a methodology called “Cacota test” which was applied and validated by cocoa producers (n = 189). It was evaluated the knowledge about the links (a. Crop design, b. Clones, c. Soil fertility, d. Pruning, e. Pests and diseases management, f. Good agricultural practices, g. Harvest, h. Post-harvest, i. Transformation, j. Marketing, k. Associativity, l. Institutionality). By means of a cluster analysis, producers were typified according to their level of knowledge and it was made a principal component analysis (PCA) to visualize the relation between the links and types of producers. It was elaborated a Cocoa Knowledge Index (CKI) and the links with greater and lesser strength regarding management level were identified. Also, the variables which influence the CKI were identified using a linear regression model. Positive correlations were found between the links: a. Clones and Soil fertility, b. Pruning and good agricultural practices, c. Pruning and pests and diseases management. The typologies were affected by the level of education, level of associativity and cultivated area. The local knowledge was not significantly related to age and gender. The proposed methodology made possible to determine the level of local knowledge of cocoa crop management practices. The institutions or people responsible for the formation of cocoa producers in the Macarena-Guaviare region should focus on crop design, clones, soil fertility, harvest, post-harvest and transformation links. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd',\n",

       " 'Over recent years in Brazil and Colombia, the social housing programs of these two countries have increasingly become directly related to the concept of green construction and seek to integrate with their respective laws. For example, a series of technological strategies allows bought countries to guarantee a reduction of the environmental impact of traditional construction technologies. Therefore, these actions try to answer the problems in the design of dwellings in Latin America. However, the construction sector reduced productivity and limited innovation in business. Some of the technological management processes in the social housing construction sector only consider the implementation of clean technologies tangentially. This situation is mainly because of general policies since they do not consider different local contexts. It is thenworth asking: What impact do the processes of transfer of clean technologies have on social housing in Brazil and Colombia? This systematic review was carried out on scientific papers indexed by the science database from 2013 to 2019. The PRISMA method was applied to this review with an aim to propose a conceptual model for the transfer of clean technology in the production of social housing in Brazil and Colombia.

The greatest contribution of our research consists in the development of an empirical study that is based on the main contributions of the dynamic capabilities promoted by Teece (absorption, adaptation and innovation), and that allowed to determine the degree of influence that managers have to take decisions and undertake sustainable ecotourism actions, both at the SME level and at the cluster level. For this reason, our research provides a better understanding of how dynamic capabilities operate at the individual commercial level, as well as at the cluster level, in the combination of absorption, adaptation and innovation capabilities to foster new sustainability narratives and maintain sustainable ecotourism.

       " 'Rational energy consumption in large buildings depends on both the users\\'consumption culture and the management systems implemented. In Colombia, few buildings have an energy management system characterized by its adaptability to the user and with a certain degree of intelligence. Thus, this document describes the summarized research process for the development of an Internet of Things (IoT) system, which has been designed to promote an intelligent lighting service in an academic environment. The IoT system orchestrates a series of sensors, monitoring systems and controlled actions, all based on the principle of making the system functions and consumption records available in real-time, via web services. The devices used are \\'Things\\' with improved functionality, becoming \"Smart Things\"within the IoT paradigm. Methodologically, an experimental process was followed, linking the development of electronic tools, the construction of services, and the development of interfaces for a pleasant user experience. Research contributes to two essential areas: intelligent buildings, through the intelligent adaptation of an environment; and sustainability and eco-innovation, since the system provides appropriate information for environmental education, in terms of real-time energy consumption, that impacts directly on the fair-use culture of a service expensive for the environment.

Firstly, the structural and measurement model was elaborated to account the relations between the latent variables and the manifest ones. Secondly, the model was identified; subsequent to this, we proceeded to calculate the adjustment indexes and using some techniques of multivariate methods. Then, we analyzed the areas of the model that did not fit properly to intervene them and thus achieve an optimal adjustment. We proposed some hypothesis that allowed us to prove positive causal relationships between the Innovation Capabilities and the variables. We had 283 observations extracted from the network of high complexity hospitals in Colombia during the years 2016 and 2017. A model with a significant adjustment that would account for the triggers of Innovation Capabilities in health care organizations was obtained. Finally, the positive impact of knowledge management, human resource management, management capabilities, organizational culture, and some factors associated with the health care Organizations on Innovation Capabilities was demonstrated. © 2020, Revista de Metodos Cuantitativos para la Economia y la Empresa.

       " \"Generating new products, services, or technologies may require drawing on available entrepreneurial human resources within the firm. Allowing an organizational climate in which employees engage as internal entrepreneurs can serve as a conduit for in-house generation of innovations. In order to sustain such innovative activity within a firm, corporate entrepreneurship integrates intentional and visible organizational conducts to engage employees in entrepreneurial behaviours that allow for revitalization and strategic renewal. In an understanding that an organizational climate influences employees behaviors, studies have found that certain organizational dimensions can increase employees' perceptions of organizational support that elicit their willingness to pursue entrepreneurial initiatives. In emerging and developing economies prevails a disparity on the capacity of firms to create an organizational climate that taps into the entrepreneurial behaviors of employees. In Latin America, even though many companies develop some type of innovation, the innovative performance of many firms lags significantly behind that of developed economies. The aim of this paper is to assess the perception of employees on five key dimensions in ten Latin American firms located in Colombia, Ecuador, Mexico, and Honduras from five different industries. To this end, the Corporate Entrepreneurship Climate Instrument (CECI) was applied to assess (1) top management support, (2) employee autonomy, (3) rewards/reinforcement, (4) time availability, and (5) organizational boundaries. Results from multivariate analysis show that the role of top managers within the company appears as one of the main inhibitors to entrepreneurial behaviour, highlighting the need for improving top management's sensitivity to supporting entrepreneurial activity of employees. Findings also reveal that employees perceive a weakness of organizational resources and incentives to entrepreneurial behavior. The practical implication of this exploratory study is that as long as traditional managerial conducts are not transformed, entrepreneurial individuals will not flourish in detriment of higher innovative organizational performance. © 2020 Academic Conferences and Publishing International Limited.

The qualitative approach was from the confrontation of the theory with the specific conditions of the object addressed (its characteristics and needs) which allowed the design of the model. The quantitative data approach was statistical. The population corresponds to the educational actors (teachers, students, administrative and management) of the medicine program, a total of 2139. The sampling was stratified and to determine the size of each of the stratum, took into account the population variances of the same and opted to use the criterion of Neyman's Affixation. For data analysis, they were presented in frequency distribution tables, with range and confidence interval measurements at 95 % (CI-95 %). Also, to observe the relationship between the variables (aspects) and the actors, a simple correspondence analysis was performed. All information was processed in the R-CRAN program. Seven surveys were designed which were validated by experts in higher education, who qualified coherence with the objectives of the study, the shape of the instrument and the clarity of the questions. The analysis of theories on intellectual capital allowed the design of the systemic-dynamic model of management of intellectual capital for the quality of institutions of higher education-SIDIGCIES, is based on three theories: Theory of dynamic capacities in the business world, of Teece, Pisano and Shuen; And, Theory of knowledge creation of Nonaka and Takeuchi. The guidelines of the National Accreditation Council (CNA) of Colombia were also taken into account for both programs and institutions. It is structured by four dynamic subsystems: human talent, research and innovation, academic administration and Social recognition. Its name is due to the way the management of intellectual capital in the IES must work, which requires an interconnected system, whose relationship is developed in a dynamic and non-static way when it is constantly moving, constantly improving and Adjustments, in constant internal interaction in each one of its elements and with the external medium. It is precisely the continuous interaction between the members of the Organization and other external agents in a careful way, which leads to the creation of new knowledge. Around the dynamic subsystems the elements that make possible the promotion and distribution of knowledge are undulating, they are: tacit knowledge, explicit knowledge, organizational knowledge and inter-organizational knowledge. In turn, the dynamic subsystems are influenced by four elements that directly affect their integral behavior and the achievement of the objectives of the IES. Without them, is not possible effective management of intellectual Capital; these are: Financial condition, national and international context, ethical-Legal aspects and physical infrastructure and material resources. The validation of the model in a medical program showed the relevance of SIDIGCIES, with the national and international requirements established for the accreditation of programs and institutions. We achieved the design of 92 indicators for measurement, distributed in each of the subsystems with this is possible a comprehensive analysis of their reality and not fractionally. Seven instruments were also designed for the actors of the teaching-learning process duly validated, counting in this way with reliable tools of measurement of the management of the CI SIDIGCIES, that allows the systematic and interdisciplinary study, oriented to identify the intellectual resources to share, employ, keep and protect them at the individual, organizational, social and global levels. It is a tool that will orient the proper management of the CI, will motivate the recognition of the value of the human talent for the production of the intangibles that there are produced, towards the recognition of the quality by the society and the State. © 2020 Centro Interamericano de Investigaciones Psicologicas y Ciencias Afines.\",\n",

The study was done using a qualitative methodology that included semi-structured interviews with tourism actors, with four main dimensions: social, economic, political, and environmental. The research revealed that, after the signing of the peace treaty, tourism in previously conflict-affected regions significantly increased due to the growth of privately owned tourism enterprises focused on profit making. However, levels of sustainable development, community involvement, and social entrepreneurship initiatives remain low; hence, the tourism value chain needs to be strengthened with local community involvement in order to reconstruct the social fabric. This can be done with social entrepreneurial practice, through sustainable tourism, or Sustainable Social Tourism, considered an innovative model that empowers communities and contributes to peace building. © Common Ground Research Networks, Luz Dary González-Cortés, Soraya Husain-Talero, All Rights Reserved.',\n",

To do so, a descriptive case study is developed applying a valuation method based on an existing model. This way, a maturity level was determined for the studied capacity. This valuation is built with primary information taken from semi-structured interviews to the directors and administrative staff in the health care provider facilities. This information was compared to the policies, strategies, processes, resources and other secondary information provided by the health care provider itself. The results thus obtained show that the innovation capacity in this IPS is heterogeneous as the dimensions thereof are not uniform, and fluctuate between extreme ends. It is due to the fact that the innovation activities in the IPS are processes requiring some formalization and strengthening.

Design: Mixed methods research. Method: The study contemplates two components: a quantitative component using a quasi-experimental analytical design before and after longitudinal intervention to determine the effectiveness of the case management model and a qualitative descriptive design to understand the experience of the participants about the model. The Administrative Department of Science, Technology and Innovation of Colombia (Colciencias) funded this project by means of call 777—November 2017, under the financing agreement No. 848—December 2017. Discussion: Addressing problems deriving from the structure of the Colombian healthcare system is crucial for implementing case management models. Furthermore, the effectiveness of such models may be affected by power relations and market failures, but the proved potential of a model may represent a generalized benefit for the Colombian health system. Impact: In Colombia, considering complications and management of chronic non-communicable diseases as isolated cases is considered as the highest cost events in healthcare provision, since an average of 12.8\\xa0million pesos is invested in each patient. This has led to rethink the management in these patients by means of a comprehensive model that guarantees the effectiveness of healthcare delivery, in the framework of a healthcare system heavily affected by payment capacity, where the market has a strong predominance, such as the case of Colombia.

The case that the paper explores focuses on experiential learning and learning in adulthood to design a learning model that considers context and socio-demographic characteristics, makes clear the interconnections between sustainability principles, entrepreneurship rationale and design methodologies and includes actions and processes of reflection and contextual interaction. Design/methodology/approach: Following a recursive argument, the paper applies design research methodology (DRM) to systematically design the “transformative innovation model” that Product Co Creation Centers (PC3) from the University of Twente (The Netherlands) has developed. Findings: Building on Kolb’s cycle of experiential learning, the result of applying DRM is a learning cycle of confrontation, observation, practice and application. The proposed learning model is applied to a specific setting in Colombia, allowing to verify and validate whether the learning model leads to the expected outcomes. It is argued that an interdisciplinary approach, a focus on feedback loops and the consideration of the context are important elements for addressing and transforming complex problems related to sustainable development from the bottom-up.

From a business perspective, technology and knowledge are fundamental assets for the growth and sustainability of the organization, being these the pillars on which competitiveness and its differentiation in the market are based. Today, technological development and the creation of new and improved products and services have become drivers for the global economy, whereas emerging as challenges for organizations that must keep pace with the advance of science, technology and innovation if they want to remain in the market being competitive and generating returns (Rios and Marroquín, 2012). Technology transfer strategies then become drivers and generators of knowledge that impact the development of technological capabilities in the company and directly or indirectly promote the growth of a sector of the economy. These types of projects bring with them an effort on the part of the organizations that use personnel, resources and time in a transfer process in search of the increase of their technological capacities and business development. In Colombia, for example, technology-based organizations are companies that usually make use of this type of transfer processes such as licensing agreements, technical assistance and services contracts, mobility of personnel towards other industries, company mergers or acquisitions or intellectual property rights, with the objective of impacting their business growth through the development of new and better products and services for the benefit of their clients, in addition to impacting the country’s industrial development. An example of this is the Corporación de Ciencia y Tecnología para el Desarrollo de la Industria Naval, Marítima y Fluvial—COTECMAR (Science and Technology Corporation for the Development of the Naval, Maritime and Fluvial Industry), which by developing technology transfer projects has achieved the country’s technological independence in terms of the manufacture of ships and naval devices, appropriating technologies and knowledge from shipyards with the most experience in the world.

       " 'In developing countries it is necessary to understand how knowledge transfer (KT) occurs via human capital from universities to regions. This transfer can be viewed as diffusion process and is one essential factor in explaining regional innovation and resulting socioeconomic developments. This phenomenon has been studied at the organizational level, however there are few contributions that consider spreading process models over networks in the macro context. This paper presents a KT model of human capital from university nodes to productive organization nodes for seven Colombian regions, and examines how the proportion of graduates absorbed by each region generates new knowledge products. The phenomenon we consider is based on the susceptible-infected-susceptible (SIS) epidemic process, where the spread parameters are related to the knowledge absorption capacity and the ineffectiveness or unused knowledge of the previous spreading process in the region. In addition, the model tries to explain the dependence of knowledge products (KP) with Science, Technology, Engineering and Math (STEM) graduates and the productive structure complexity. To validate the model, we have used the data of13 consecutive years obtained from the Education Ministry, as well as from the Science and Technology Observatory of Colombia. Our findings reflect that the proposed model explains the KT phenomenon, where each node or region is a heterogeneous node, because they have different absorption and ineffectiveness parameters, as well as, diverse productive structure configurations. © 2018 IEEE.',\n",

In Colombia, the mining panorama was and continues to be ruled by a formal, modern, and large-scale mining mainly focused in coal, the exploitation of nickel, and some companies that exploit gold in different places. Also, a large part of the mining activity is done at minor scales, defined in many cases by informality and the subsistence character. Bearing sustainability in mind, it is worth asking about the balance implies by the exploitation without added value of local and strategic materials that are irreversibly scarcer every time, including metallic and non-metallic minerals.

       " 'Industrial symbiosis refers to a collaborative strategy of exchanging physical resources and sharing services among industrial actors, which enhances the resource efficiency and reduces the environmental impacts of industrial operations within the network. Although it can contribute to sustainable development in emerging economies, few studies have examined the dynamics of industrial symbiosis in such regions. We initiated a capacity-building pilot program for industrial symbiosis in Colombia and formulated 20 industrial symbiosis projects with 36 companies. Based on our experience over the first year, we conducted an exploratory case study of the mechanisms that facilitate the development of industrial symbiosis. Specifically, we analyzed the nature of this facilitation and how its activities influence the key determining factors of industrial symbiosis in technical, economic, organizational, social, and institutional categories. Our facilitation approach focused on identifying opportunities and building capacity for industrial symbiosis innovation by influencing mainly the organizational and social factors. The facilitation approach requires further adjustments and experimentation to expand industrial symbiosis and to ensure the eventual implementation of these projects. This study contributes to the understanding of management perspectives of industrial symbiosis development in the context of an emerging economy. © 2018 by the authors.',\n",

       " 'With increasing problems related to the management of end-of-life products, emerging economies have adopted an environmental policy principle – Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR), following the example of OECD countries. Colombia was one of the early adopters in Latin America, having introduced EPR in 2007 to manage several end-of-life products, such as pesticide containers, medicines, lead acid batteries, light bulbs, small batteries, computers, and tires. However, there has been no comprehensive investigation into how EPR has been applied in the context of Colombia. Using the case of end-of-life tires, this study aimed to provide an understanding about two aspects of the EPR system in Colombia: the governance structure and the performance in the end-of-life management. This study found that the Colombian EPR governance model imposes full financial and operational responsibilities on tire producers and importers, while it fails to incentivize other actors in the product chain to carry out their allocated tasks and responsibilities. As for the performance, the EPR system has increased the amount of tires collected over the last five years, but the level is low compared with other developed countries, and more importantly, it does not fully promote the recovery of values from tire waste. The analysis of the current situation in Colombia and lessons from other countries suggest that the effectiveness of the EPR policy would require the establishment of solid, but feasible targets, while allowing flexibility in meeting those targets. It would also benefit from the consideration of economic instruments, as well as establishment of complementary policies to promote innovation and strengthen the regulatory controls over the free riders and management of tire waste. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd',\n",
       " \"In recent years, Corporate Universities have become a critical element in the development of human capital inside companies, institutions and organizations, promoting strategies based on knowledge management as an essential factor to achieve social innovation and sustainable competitive advantages aligned with the strategy. Therefore it is essential for these institutions to reach the highest levels of efficiency and excellence in company processes and structures and to achieve planned corporate goals and objectives. In this work an extensive and thorough review of the current literature was carried out in relation to the concept, in order to analyse the latest trends in Corporate Universities. A comparative evaluation with traditional university aspects was performed, identifying their own differentiators, for example the impact on social innovation, the development of sustainable com- petitive advantages, the influence on the company's internal environment, the importance of cultural and technological factors, and the relationship with the orga- nizations strategy, which are important factors in its successful development and interconnection within the company processes. The information obtained from the aforementioned literature review, in combination with the experience gained by the team of consultants and researchers at the PRIME Business School, Sergio Arboleda University, Bogota, Colombia, allowed to present proposed in general terms a new implementation model of Corporate University. This new model is based on five distinct phases, and with minor adaptations could be to any sector in an organization. The study shows that through this Corporate University model, an organization could gain differentiators to increase social innovation, in time gain sustainable competitive advantages, and a desirable alignment with the objectives and strategic goals of the organization. © Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature 2018.

       " 'In recent years, there has been a change in the topic of protection of the elderly in the world, due to the demographic transition process involving growth in the aging of the population and the foreseeable consequences. This is the reason why there has been a need for a common frame of reference for the welfare, protection and promotion of the rights of the elderly, including the contribution they can make to society, as well as the products and services that they perceive according to the requirements they demand. This article shares some results of the study*, carried out between 2012 and 2015 in two contexts, Colombia and Spain, whose objective was to understand the social reality of a growing market segment and the importance of current government and social policies for the protection and quality of life in senior citizen population. Health deteriorates generally as it advances in age, requiring special attention in the medium and long term, transposed into greater demand for services for the older person. Social economy companies are called to take action on the matter, considering, in truth, of components of the social quadrihelix, composed of: a) academia, through the approach of new professional skills, the exchange of experiences and the promotion of good practices, in addition to research and innovation for the elderly, b) the company, generating or providing appropriate services and products for this population, c) local, regional and national government through the enactment and implementation of the national policy of aging, seeking the protection and defense of the rights of the elderly, and d) the community, through volunteering and the inclusion of the person in conditions of social vulnerability. Thus, the four fronts, imply the commitment that both the citizen and the institutions have to society, in a common work under the same purpose, make visible the degree of corporate and institutional social responsibility and the implementation in benefit of appropriately intervening the situation of old age of population, coordinating and promoting national and international cooperation initiatives that create links with different stakeholders, in order to meet the needs, desires, expectations and tastes, through the quality and relevance of the service perceived by the older person, both in the residences where they live, the products they buy and consume, inside and outside the environment where they reside. The advances of science in recent years has been vertiginous, in a more significant way in medicine and in the new technologies applied to medical science in the pharmacological field, favouring longevity with quality life for the elderly, providing them with the opportunity for more autonomy, physical and mental activity. At the same time, it means that companies and institutions must offer new and better services in accordance with the expectations and needs, not only of the elderly, but also of the family members and administrative staff of the home/residence who need to improve the well-being of the person in charge of, allowing the user to make their own decisions of where to live, what products to consume, which brands and characteristics according to benefits they perceive and require. This is how, from the theoretical review on key conceptions of the elderly**, the demographic trends, the institutional framework of welfare policies in protection and social responsibility that affect the population of the elderly and that could influence health, housing, security and pensions, the variables to be taken into account were defined and three structured surveys and a questionnaire were designed to obtain primary information, highlighting the residences as a starting point and the public involved: seniors, relatives, directors of residential centers and subject matter experts. Allowing to contextualize \"in a general way\" the social welfare, the socioeconomic situation of the elderly population and the social policies that shelter it, as well as the business environment considered a challenge in the population aging process, which goes from managing human talent as a strategic asset in a competitive society until defining and implementing inclusive public policies. Reaching some theories and approaches of entrepreneurship social responsibility and the relationship between business / senior citizens, starting from the liberal relation to the approach of social institutions and thus get to relate some considerations of the residential environment (Colombia-Spain) and quality components of life as a foundation of the social welfare of the elderly as a being of multiple and interdependent needs. Finally, the study shows how, in Spain, in contrast to Colombia, interventions for the benefit of the elderly are notable, from the relationship with workers, volunteers and families. Meanwhile, corporate relations in social management, cooperation and solidarity, are found to be more visible in Spain as a comprehensive strategy and social content, however in both contexts there are gaps in innovation, in processes and products for the activity and physical mobility of this population. In same way, they are also working on the relationship: social responsibility / innovation. In Colombia, some progress has been made, but there is still a lack of promotion, articulation and initiatives of internal and external social responsibility, since there are no clear guidelines in a social responsibility management system that supports initiatives and proposals to manage participation or links with other entities of different sectors. However, in both contexts, it is necessary to coordinate and promote national and international cooperation, which allow the link with different stakeholders, in order to achieve the satisfaction of needs and desires, as well as the quality and relevance of perceived service by the older adult, in the residences and in the external environment where they reside. © 2018 CIRIEC-España.',\n",

Hosting the World Urban Forum in 2014 allowed it to showcase its approach, key elements of which have been: creation of innovative transport infrastructure linking poorer peripheral districts to the city centre; culture-led regeneration; strong support of local development from the local business sector; and a successful municipally-owned utilities company. However, the city is spreading outwards without services and employment being provided; new low-income developments are replicating high-rise models which failed worldwide; there is limited intervention in the existing informal areas, many being in highly vulnerable locations where the level of risk is likely to increase with climate change; development has little regard for topography, ecological and environmental considerations; investment in accessible and good quality public space is restricted to some areas; the quality of the public realm does not always support health and wellbeing of the ageing population. This paper explores the institutional and socio-economic context in which Medellín has achieved the internationally recognized status of an ‘innovative city’. It questions to what extent social equity, environmental sustainability and citizen empowerment have been promoted as per the ULI claims when it conferred the prize. The paper queries the extent to which ‘urban innovation’ is happening in Medellín, which has considerable implications given its recently found role as a ‘model’ city in Latin America and beyond. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd',\n",

       " 'Background and Objective. Seventy percent of the major burn patients have face burns and their surgical management depends on the depth of the burn; usually full thickness burns have to undergo early tangential excision with immediate coverage once the patient is stable and in the partial thickness facial burns the surgical management is dermoabrasion and coverage with topical agents, synthetic dressings or biological dressings. However, the dressing changes with topical agents are painful and frequent procedures and many of the synthetic and biological dressings are expensive and not available for some health systems. The aim of this study was to evaluate the use of amniotic membrane glicerol preserved 85%, as a transient biological dressing in the management of partial and total thickness facial burns. Methods. We developed an observational descriptive prospective study case series of 52 consecutive patients. We used exposed 85% glycerol preserved amniotic membrane as a transient biological coverage provided by the Science, Biotechnology and Innovation District Institute of Health (IDCBIS) of the Health Secretary of Bogotá (Colombia), without secondary dressings, immediately after mechanic dermoabrasion in patients with partial and total thickness facial burns. Results. All the patients epithelialized between the 5th and 10th day with only one application of the amniotic membrane without secondary dressings or topical agents; also the patients did not show wound healing alterations. Some patients stayed in the hospital longer than 10 days because they presented major burns. None of them presented infection and all referred absence of pain during the postoperative period. Conclusions. The use of amniotic membrane as a transient biological dressing for the treatment of partial and total thickness facial burns is an economic, effective and available tool in countries with skin banks. The use of the amniotic membrane after the dermoabrasion avoids daily wound dressing changes, decreases and controls the pain and promotes wound healing and epithelization. © 2018 Sociedad Espanola de Cirugia Plastica Reparadora y Estetica (SECPRE).

The main goal of this project was to contribute in social and economic reinsertion of young offenders within society by developing labour and social skills, and, therefore, helping them to improve their livelihood and life quality. The strategy consisted in a participatory design and implementation of the project named \"Popular Design, Productive Chains and Peace Building\" in the municipalities of Cartagena and Turbaco (Bolivar, Colombia). The project envisioned not only teaching to these minors inmates how to build handcrafts, but also included the construction of sustainable productive chains providing great value to their artisanal work. These NEOCraftstrategy (handicrafts renovation movement) included the handmade products transcendence, its environmental responsibility, the use of natural materials and waste management. Therefore, the fundamental value of the craftsmanship lies on its cultural and ancestral tradition that gives uniqueness to the product, separating it from the mass and global consumption of branded products. For ASOMENORES, and for this specific project, the social rehabilitation and reinsertion into society depends on various factors: one of them is the psychological rehabilitation provided by the penitentiary; another factor, the intervention was originated by this project through the construction of productive chains. The strategy was focused on determining skills’ assessment of each participant. From that starting point, the result was the development of individual, technical and competitive advantages. These advantages emphasised over their culture, traditions and perspectives, where was planned to create and innovate with systemic awareness, inclusive and participative added value. It is expecting once the participants are resealed, they will be prepare, with proper tools, to be part of different companies as employees or create their own business. In this way, there is a high probability of decreasing their chances for these young guys to commit an offence again.

       " 'Countries like Japan, South Korea, Israel and Sweden, among others, has proven that the value of a region does not depend solely from natural resources, but intellectual capital is also necessary to create capabilities towards regional development. Bogota, the biggest city of Colombia, concentrates most of the financial and human resources of the country. However, the indexes and measures of regional innovation does not reflect this capability of the city, and most the structures supporting the innovational plans of Bogota are ill implemented or not implemented at all. Even if transform a resources-based economy to a knowledge-based is slow, an appropriate structure and clear roles of the public and private organizations could boost this change. Therefore, this research shows an analysis of the structure of the regional innovation system (RIS), specially focused on information flows, cooperation mechanisms, and collaborative work. Using rigorous organizational cybernetics methods and social network analysis, an initial diagnosis shows that the RIS of Bogota does not connect properly each one of the activities of the system within organizations. Likewise, a lack of communication and control mechanisms result in fragmentation between subsystems and their activities. Based on these results, a proposal for a synergetic network is presented, where resources and activities are tied up. This proposal of public policy shows the advantages of the changes on the relationships between actors, and possible improvement on the communication and control mechanisms. © 2018 Institute of Industrial Engineers (IIE).

Finalmente hacemos una revisión del marco normativo para proponer algunos elementos teóricos que son la base de la investigación. Este artículo es la realización del primer objetivo específico del proyecto en mención. © 2018 CIRIEC-España.In Colombia, the theoretical and doctrinal origin for the definition and conceptualization of what is understood by solidary economy is not very clear, for this reason we consider the realization of a research project that will lead us to this. The first result is presented in this article. The objective is to present the theoretical reflection that will allow us to have an analysis guide to define the solidarity economy in Colombia. Through a qualitative methodology based on the method of documentary analysis and using different information collection techniques, we analyze two demographic trends that have had an impact on the definition of solidarity economy in Colombia. The first is the Latin American current and the second is the current social and solidarity economy. Finally, we review the regulatory framework to propose some theoretical elements that are the basis of the investigation. This article is the realization of the first specific objective of the project in mention. As results, we find that in Latin America we can mention two currents. The first refers to the ethical- moral current that has as main authors Luis Razeto and Pablo Guerra. The second is the economic current of the solidarity economy with important authors such as José Luis Coraggio, Max Neef and Singer. In Europe, we find a vision called social economy, its main exponents are Jose Luis Monzón and Rafael Chávez in Spain and Jean Luis Laville in France. These definitions allowed us to discuss the denomination used in Colombia and confirm that the term solidarity economy represents in Colombia an important sector that encompasses countless organizations in different parts of the national territory. These organizations are based on collective and community work seeking the solution to specific problems. Solidarity economy is another way of looking at the relationship between economy, human and his context, where he bases his actions on loyalty practices with culture, humanity, territory, in search of a balance between being, having and living. In Colombia, through Law 454 of 1998 two types of organizations are distinguished, those of solidarity economy and solidarity developed, there are organizations of a solidary nature such as cooperatives, employee funds, mutual associations but also We recognize associations, corporations, foundations, volunteer groups, community action boards, among many others that respond to the conceptual and empirical characteristics of the solidarity economy mentioned below. The main conclusions refer to the characteristics of the solidarity economy in Colombia. From the social point of view, the solidarity economy is the means to achieve the social development sought by the territories. From the economic point of view, it is a new rationality of movement, use, accumulation and relationship between the economic factor and being. From the political point of view, self-management seeks the independence of the State in relation to its decisions. However, it is a movement that projects changes within public policy focused on equity between the social, economic, cultural and environmental. From the territorial aspect, it seeks to protect the development of the territory, coexisting with its geographic and cultural context, exploring new rationalities of territory from its socio-economic and cultural practices. From the cultural point of view, it seeks to recognize its origin in solidarity, cooperative and mutualist practices, striving to rescue them again, invigorate them and encourage them from and for the territories with new forms of organization. From the environmental aspect, it seeks the generation of territorial development balanced with the environment and its social context. From the organizational point of view, it is based on the participative, valued activity towards the human being and his capacities, the self-management, the associativity, the solidarity and cooperation are transversal in the organizational structures. From the individual, considers that the person is the end and not a means, take it to their freedoms is one of the purposes so that once free contribute to the overall development of society. Finally, it seeks the participation of the human being as the end of social, political, economic and cultural relations and realities, as a leading actor that seeks continuous but dynamic and changing development, guaranteeing solidarity, cooperative and respectful coexistence with others and their environment. Unlike Latin American countries such as Brazil, Argentina and Uruguay, in Colombia the solidarity economy hardly emerges as an incipient social movement, because it does not have enough identity to give it meaning given the existing heterogeneity and diversity of practices that could be categorized as solidarity economies. The social actors that are participating in the construction of the solidarity economy are varied and diverse; unions, universities, entities of the solidarity economy system, the State, the private sector, the church, international cooperation, organized civil society, popular rural and urban movements, which are called to the strength of the social movement seeking public policies that recognizes the importance of the solidary sector in Colombia. Some Colombian universities have developed since the mid-twentieth century, research programs made up of research groups that have different lines of work related to solidarity economy, as well as formal undergraduate and postgraduate and non-formal teaching programs such as continuing education programs. extension programs that mean work with the community and dissemination actions represented by journals, books, texts and academic events to present research results as well as national university networks (the Unicossol Network Corporation and Ciriec Colombia) related to international networks since decades ago, which have advanced significantly in the construction not only of the concept, but of a culture, movement and social force of the solidarity economy. These networks and research processes allow the solidarity economy to be recognized as a growing sector in the country, with important challenges in terms of the territorial reorganization that Colombia is currently experiencing, as a result of the negotiation processes with the armed groups. The solidarity organizations have emerged and continue to appear as a result of the absence of the State and the urgency of solutions to social problems that have arisen because of the war in Colombia. This particularity in Colombia makes the study of the solidarity economy urgent and necessary in a country where research has been difficult to develop, public investment in rural development processes, access to different territories, among others. Finally, the contribution of this article is based on the effort made by the Unicossol Network in recognizing the solidarity economy as the main source of development in Colombia. The union of researchers from different universities at national level, with different points of view and with experiences in the territory has facilitated the discussion and the approach to the definition of a term little studied in Colombia. © 2018 CIRIEC-España.',\n",

       " 'Agricultural producers grapple with low farm yields and declining ecosystem services within their landscapes. In several instances, agricultural production systems may be considered largely unsustainable in socioeconomic and ecological (resource conservation and use and impact on nature) terms. Novel technological and management options that can serve as vehicles to promote the provision of multiple benefits, including the improvement of smallholder livelihoods, are needed. We call for a paradigm shift to allow designing and implementing agricultural systems that are not only efficient (serving as a means to promote development based on the concept of creating more goods and services while using fewer resources and creating less waste) but can also be considered synergistic (symbiotic relationship between socio-ecological systems) by simultaneously contributing to major objectives of economic, ecological, and social (equity) improvement of agro-ecosystems. These transformations require strategic approaches that are supported by participatory system-level research, experimentation, and innovation. Using data from several studies, we here provide evidence for technological and management options that could be optimized, promoted, and adopted to enable agricultural systems to be efficient, effective, and, indeed, sustainable. Specifically, we present results from a study conducted in Colombia, which demonstrated that, in rice systems, improved water management practices such as AlternateWetting and Drying (AWD) reduce methane emissions (~70%). We also show how women can play a key role in AWD adoption. For livestock systems, we present in vitro evidence showing that the use of alternative feed options such as cassava leaves contributes to livestock feed supplementation and could represent a cost-effective approach for reducing enteric methane emissions (22% to 55%). We argue that to design and benefit from sustainable agricultural systems, there is a need for better targeting of interventions that are co-designed, co-evaluated, and co-promoted, with farmers as allies of transformational change (as done in the climate-smart villages), not as recipients of external knowledge. Moreover, for inclusive sustainability that harnesses existing knowledge and influences decision-making processes across scales, there is a need for constant, efficient, effective, and real trans-disciplinary communication and collaboration. © 2017 by the authors.',\n",

Despite the importance, theoretically given to the TICs, a great gap is found in the scientific literature regarding the measurements of these capabilities in the higher education sector. In this paper, the results of the implementation of a fuzzy inference diagnostic system for organizational capabilities for innovation in a university institution (UI) in the city of Medellin, Colombia are presented. The system consists of the application of a structured diagnostic instrument - type interviewed-to the management and teaching staff of the institution. The data is adapted to the requirements of a fuzzy inference system, in which previously defined variables are related, their values are standardized and entered in an inference system. The values were implemented and processed in the Fuzzy Logic Toolbox - MATLAB.

       " 'At the end of the first decade of the 21st century, the issues surrounding the quality of water resources are increasingly evident at the global and regional levels. However, under the influence of the environmental reform of the 1990s in Colombia, the institutional framework sought to avoid the threat by leaning towards the decentralized management of sustainability and the application of economic instruments such as the compensatory rate (Pigouvian tax). The purpose of this article is to review the performance of these two standards against the role of civil society in the intervention on water quality in the high basin of the Cauca river. For this, the institutional analysis combined with econometric tools including models with panel, ANOVA and finally main components are used. In the end, the scope of civic citizenship as a complement or alternative to the typical tools of the regionalized public administration is discussed. The results show, among many others, the harmlessness of financial instruments such as compensatory rates to attack water contamination, along with the capacity of social organizations to control associative processes in defense of the river water quality. © 2017 Universidad de Caldas.',\n",

This seems common in third world countries. Intelligent Knowledge based systems (IKBS) have to do with the creation of value from intangible intelligent assets, that are resurrected from amalgams of Artificial Intelligence, Knowledge Engineering (KE), BUSINESS PROCESS REENGINEERING (BPR), Cognitive Systems Engineering, Software Engineering, and Third Millennium organizations, among others. Intelligent behavior requires being able to acquire and manage information, data and knowledge to make effective decisions for organizations to function intelligently in crises. Requires intellectually demanding environments with more open minds. The U. San Jose-FESSANJOSE has developed a supportive environment for decision-making in the complexity of higher education (HE), and a set of planning tools has been designed to deal with the crisis. These tools, are expected to help stakeholders develop and communicate understanding of high priority issues so that smart decisions can be made and implemented during crises in the case of Colombia. After 60 years of war confrontation (civil society, guerrilla, paramilitary) we are preparing toward a post-conflict situation; for labor re-qualification of thousands of victims a new education model based on integrating architectures and knowledge systems is proposed. The post-agreement implies greater social investment especially in education, towards the reconstruction of Peace and Equity that goes beyond social mobility (e.g. employment) with new educational models based on high quality and decentralization. Nowadays the Government of Colombia (GoC) signed an Agreement with the guerilla FARC after 6 years of talks. In the following days the Peace Nobel Prize was granted to the GoC President, Juan M. Santos. The following days new dialogues, with the minor and remaining guerilla ELN, was announced for starting soon in Ecuador. If succeed, the total peace will be warranted. The new educational model, involves: • Individual monitoring and evaluation, • guided by ICT (information and communicationstechnologies), • competencies (supported by KE) • asynchronous methodolyg, • personal tutoring: teaching/automated online (includingmobile devices usage), • for the population of young and adult, victims of armedconflicts, • for people preparation for the IV Industrial Revolution,and to face the transition to the Digital Transformation(to radically improve performance of institutions) Regarding the social situation, in our side we are preparing for a post-conflict situation; we have to prepare thousands of demobilized people and victims, requiring labor re-qualification. In addition, given the deficit of 100,000 ICT Engineers, and 300,000 Technologist (T) and Professional Technicians (PT), e.g. programmers; our proposal is intended as a disruptive innovation to address the post-war digital divide, and this country has based human talent mental rehabilitation, with training and labor requalification. We integrated our own experiences and proposed a new education model, based on the integration into an Intelligent Management Information System (iMIS), of 5 architectures that we previously have implemented in several higher education Institutions (HEI) in Colombia. Those architectures, supported by the convergence of Information, Software, and KE, with Artificial & Computational Intelligence, and guided by mathematical and computational models. iMIS integrates hybrid multilevel architectures with multilevel systems, in order to respond to the solution of HE-ME (middle education) problems, leading to face competitiveness and productivity, observing specifically how to include these technologies for evolving the university into modernity, bringing together the institution governability, the student and teacher productivity, and the High Quality Education (HQE). The paper characterizes an intelligent educational organization of the III millennium, defines post-conflict crises, and discusses a competency-based educational model as part of the alternatives to confront the national crisis with an educational crisis management framework. We are trying to consolidate numerous experiential learnings related to the complexity of HE such as student dropout, educational quality, productivity and competitiveness in an underdeveloped country like Colombia.

       " 'Purpose: This paper aims to explore the relationship between clustering and hotel competitiveness in emerging economy destinations by analyzing potential mediation of the management innovations implemented. Design/methodology/approach: This empirical study is based on hotel-level information from a survey including 131 hotels in 2014. Colombia was chosen as a representative of Colombia, Indonesia, Vietnam, Egypt, Turkey and South Africa (CIVETS) emerging destinations. The relationships were analyzed by structural modeling and partial least squares. Findings: Clustering has a positive direct impact on hotel competitiveness and innovation, and there is a positive effect of innovation on competitiveness. Therefore, the link between clustering and competitiveness is partially mediated through implementation of management innovations. Practical implications: Hotels should actively participate in agglomerated destinations and build relationships with established firms by clustering. Interaction with related firms and implementation of management innovations will lead to increased levels of economic competitiveness. Public policymakers should foster collaborative strategic networking in the hospitality industry of emerging economy destinations. Originality/value: This paper focused on separating the direct and indirect effects of clustering on hotel competitiveness. Implementation of management innovations was considered as an outcome derived from clustering in emerging tourist destinations, using the example of Colombia. Clustering stimulates and eases management innovations within the location, and that combination reinforces the role that cooperating while competing plays in hotel competitiveness for destinations with lagging innovation. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.',\n",

Despite all this, there are aspects -such as digital divide- that occur again, to a greater or lesser extent, in the different Latin American countries. This digital divide promotes partially disconnected -and thus, invisible- societies, and tends to slow down possibilities of innovation and development of digital journalism. Methodology: In this study, and from the methodology proposed by Rodríguez, Codina & Pedraza (2012), we have analysed the management of interactivity in the main digital media in Mexico, Colombia and Ecuador in 2016.

       " 'The purpose of this article is to explore the differences in product and process innovation capabilities (ICs) and financial performance (FP) in manufacturing companies in Colombia. In the methodology, a cluster analysis was performed which identified three groups of companies with similar characteristics: innovators, explorers and stragglers. An analysis of variance (ANOVA) was also performed to establish meaningful differences in the means. The results show that for product ICs there are significant differences in the development of routines aimed at developing environmentally friendly products and improvements in design. Meanwhile, for processing ICs there are significant differences with regard to the incorporation of basic but essential business technologies and the management of interrelated technologies. However, for financial performance differences are significant in terms of sales growth and increased market share. In conclusion, the development of product and process ICs does not guarantee better results in sales growth and market share compared with smaller companies that have made less of an effort to consolidate such routines. This is probably due to other organizational capabilities that may be more decisive in the commercial success of products. © 2017.',\n",

Develop a model based on a frame logic to quantify SMEs' internationalization by integrating linguistic variables such as human talent, infrastructure, innovation strategies, FTAs, marketing strategy and finance, among others. It is argued that the company management of international markets depends on internal factors, especially the capabilities and resources available, based on the premise that the profits made by a company depend on external factors (competitive environmental features) and internal factors (the integration of resources available), those latter are perhaps this research's biggest challenge, because it is required to propose a suitable battery of capabilities and define their importance and strategic relevance to building competitive advantages. Design/ Methodology/Approach. Fuzzy inference system is proposed to model the resources, skills and competencies that determine internationalisation success. Data: 157 linguistic variables are used, arisen from entrepreneurs, experts, consultants and researchers in international trade, and through expert judgment, 18 factors explaining export capabilities are defined. The proposed model is applied by means of a case study of the textile and clothing cluster in Medellin, Colombia. Findings. In model's implementing it got a particular global index of 28.2 for internationalisation capabilities. The result confirms the hypothesis that the capabilities and resources currently available to the sector analyzed, are not sufficient for a successful integration into the international market, and most importantly, specifies the factors and variables to intervene to improve the export's capability. Limitations. In the particular case of textile companies, is highlighted the lack of a continuous information record and very few studies directed towards the long-term plans development.

       " 'Constant changes in technology pose continuous challenges for higher education institutions that are training the engineers of the future. These changes are making it necessary to adapt the curriculum in order to develop the skills needed by the XXI century engineer. Moreover, instead of thinking in a large curriculum reform at a specific moment, it is necessary to define curriculum management processes that include change as a natural component of the process. In addition to these global trends, each institution has a particular context and thus, the analysis in each institution has unique characteristics, a common methodological approach, and a reference model that can be built as long as it is flexible enough to include that context. This paper describes a model developed for curriculum management inside the School of Engineering at Universidad EAFIT - Colombia. This model includes the institutional context and is based on a process approach defined by the Business Process Management (BPM) methodology. The model uses the Burlton Hexagon as a theoretical framework to identify organizational structure, strategies, policies, infrastructure, technology tools and human capital. It is also a mechanism for specifying curricular macro processes including the global and institutional context. The proposed model is based on three pillars: (a) scientific research in education, which promotes the use of the scientific method as a strategy to ensure an approach to problems based on evidence which allows the construction of educational innovation projects, (b) education engineering focused on engineering education, which transforms the learning by developing basic, professional, and transversal skills as well as those specific for an engineer of the XXI century, and (c) interactive educational communities, both face to face and virtual, as spaces for knowledge management that support collaborative working and experience-sharing, managed by its members working together promoting initiatives to develop educational innovation projects focused on specific topics, that answer questions related to teaching and learning needs. The formulation and development of educational innovation projects are the responses to different needs identified on specific courses that are transformed into research questions. These projects aim to renew the curriculum so that it dynamically evolves based on classroom experiences. Thus, the curriculum renewal is based on critical thinking about the problems found in engineering education. The use of the scientific method and the collaborative approach enables drawing solid conclusions based on the experimental results. The model proposes the formulation and development of innovative educational projects in which scientific research applied in education aims to transform teaching, academic and administrative practices. As consequence, curricular innovations that integrate learning objects and educational, methodological and assessment strategies, are developed by an interactive learning community composed by teachers. Finally, the results obtained by applying the model in some courses in the School of Engineering of Universidad EAFIT are presented. These results include reducing the drop-out rate of students, redefining admission and graduation profiles, and micro-curricular redesign based on competences using projects, among others. © 2014 IEEE.',\n",
       " 'The aim of the paper is to propose answers to the research question: What are the variables associated with knowledge management, which are conducted by the research groups of higher education institutions -HEI- in Colombia? This problem was identified by analyzing two major tensions. First, between the socially relevant knowledge and knowledge required by the market; and second, between the social research and research oriented by science, technology and innovation. These tensions put the knowledge management, which are conducted by the research groups, at the center of analysis. The methodology used is a case study of a qualitative and descriptive type, for which interviews and analysis of the curriculum vitae of directors and members of research groups were conducted. Review of literature on knowledge management was made, and research done on this topic by HEI. The findings are shown in three groups of variables associated with knowledge management: a) the research structure: planning, resource management, openness to change, leadership, teamwork, initiative, partnership, research training and employment; b) the research process: the problem and research questions, hypotheses, methodology, analysis and interpretation of results, participation in calls, regulation, research platforms and academic production; and c) the innovation process: prospective vision, interaction with the environment, creativity and use of information technologies. The findings indicate that the knowledge management in research groups, should be redirected through institutional policies articulated to the scientific and technological development. Although research groups perform activities resulting from the model of knowledge management (socialization, outsourcing, combination, and internationalization), these are not always practiced in a conscious way; and they also have structural difficulties during the research process, hindering the transfer of knowledge. Taking into account that HEI have integrated management systems that support the research process, it still requires improving the quality of these stages of management. The usefulness of the results leads to rethink policies that guide the processes of institutional research, and redirect knowledge management that is performed from the research groups. This for to move from the structuring of research problems arising from a weak conception of knowledge, to others where sociocultural realities are the benchmark for its formulation. Also aims to consolidate knowledge management from improving academic productivity of research groups, despite the risks of productivism. This is because the productivism is characterized by the proliferation of scientific papers based on the logic of the stacking, but, not of the knowledge creation and its social relevance..

This document is the result of the analysis of the signals of the sector, second component of the preliminary stage of the DECK Study carried out by Bio Gerencia Virtual®. The main official sources of the food and beverage industry in Colombia were analyzed to detect the potential of this industry to create value by transforming knowledge into innovation. From analysis of the industry variables, signals that can become the basis for indicators are identified and propose a path of positive development for the sector: Transforming a traditional sector into one driven by knowledge. Peter M. Senge and others have referred to the deep learning cycle as the essence of the learning organization. When major changes are required, a deep learning cycle operates and can happen individually or collectively. In the Paisa Culture Prototype, a prototype of Knowledge Management for Innovation, whose base is the DECK Study, analyzes of specific sectors of the Colombian economy is included. If we understand each sector as a team able to create what it wants to create, the deep learning cycle will be relevant to each economic sector. In particular, the food and beverage industry of Colombia depends largely on the rich biodiversity of Colombia. The greatest opportunities for the sector can be found in the governmental purpose of transforming the Colombian industry. The food sector is at the center of this transformation; but, according to the findings, if the deep learning cycle is not activated, the transformation will not occur; and therefore neither will there be knowledgebased innovation.

       " 'Innovation and technology, in appropriate business environments, are considered improvement and survival tools directly related to the establishment of competitive advantages. However, this must be accompanied by a growing economy, and, in some cases, governmental policies that encourage the industry. This chapter inquires about several factors involved in the innovation and technological change of the pork industry in Antioquia, Colombia, based on original research results and other contributions of the authors. The managerial assumption is simple: free trade and strategic moves of the biggest competitors indicate that Small- and Medium-Sized Enterprises (SMEs) in the pork industry must accelerate their technological change via innovation management by addressing different factors that are hindering the establishment of competitive advantages. The authors offer a possible path of action from a management perspective to support that the industry will form an oligopoly should innovation management not occur. © 2014 by IGI Global.

However, to date, few studies have been made regarding the capacities for innovation underlying their good results in developing new and improved products. The objective of this article is to determine the maturity ofthe innovation capacities for five ofthese companies. The theoretical model of Essmann and Du Preez (2009) was used, which consists ofthree dimensions: a construct for innovation capacity, a maturity scale and an organizational construct. In terms of methodology, an index of innovative capacity was constructed and the ranges for three maturity levels were calculated, using the analysis cluster (Jung et al, 2009); this permitted classifying the companies under study. Results show that all the companies have a maturity level titled formalized and predictable. In conclusion, although the best practices associated with each innovation capacity have been identified and implemented, individuals have not appropriated them and do not use them in a systematic manner. © 2014, Universidad del Zulia.

       " 'Colombia has been transformed into the third country with the best business environment in L.A.; however, investment in Research, Development and Innovation (RD&I) is only 0,2% of the GPD. Taking into account that 98% of the Colombian enterprises are SMEs, from which 5% invest only 2% of its annual budget in design, the National Industrial Design Program (MinCIT) saw the need to develop the Integral Design Tutoring Model. The model makes a bet for empathy and emotional intimacy as tools to transfer the necessary knowledge so that the local businessperson develops an innovation culture based on design thinking. To test the model, the Integral Design Tutoring Project was developed as a pilot. This fourmonths project allowed an interdisciplinary team, conducted by designers, to accompany twenty SMEs. Through a process developed in three stages it was possible to prove that, through empathy and emotional intimacy, one can achieve knowledge transfer to business people and their organizations in an effective, efficient and successful way.

       " 'Introduction Standardized trauma protocols (STP) have reduced morbidity and in-hospital mortality in mature trauma systems. Most hospitals in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) have not implemented STPs, often because of financial and logistic limitations. We report the impact of an STP designed for the care of trauma patients in the emergency department (ED) at an LMIC hospital on patients with severe traumatic brain injury (STBI). Methods We developed an STP based on generally accepted best practices and damage control resuscitation for a level I trauma centre in Colombia. Without a pre-existing trauma registry, we adapted an administrative electronic database to capture clinical information of adult patients with TBI, a head abbreviated injury score (AIS) ≥3, and who presented ≤ 12 h from injury. Demographics, mechanisms of injury, and injury severity were compared. Primary outcome was in-hospital mortality. Secondary outcomes were Glasgow Coma Score (GCS), length of hospital and ICU stay, and prevalence of ED interventions recommended in the STP. Logistic regression was used to control for potential confounders. Results The pre-STP group was hospitalized between August 2010 and August 2011, the post-STP group between September 2011 and June 2012. There were 108 patients meeting inclusion criteria, 68 pre-STP implementation and 40 post-STP. The pre- and post-STP groups were similar in age (mean 37.1 vs. 38.6, p = 0.644), head AIS (median 4.5 vs. 4.0, p = 0.857), Injury Severity Scale (median 25 vs. 25, p = 0.757), and initial GCS (median 7 vs. 7, p = 0.384). Post-STP in-hospital mortality decreased (38% vs. 18%, p = 0.024), and discharge GCS increased (median 10 vs. 14, p = 0.034). After controlling for potential confounders, odds of in-hospital mortality post-STP compared to pre-STP were 0.248 (95%CI: 0.074-0.838, p = 0.025). Hospital and ICU stay did not significantly change. The use of many ED interventions increased post-STP, including bladder catheterization (49% vs. 73%, p = 0.015), hypertonic saline (38% vs. 63%, p = 0.014), arterial blood gas draws (25% vs. 43%, p = 0.059), and blood transfusions (3% vs. 18%, p = 0.008). Conclusions An STP in an LMIC decreased in-hospital mortality, increased discharge GCS, and increased use of vital ED interventions for patients with STBI. An STP in an LMIC can be implemented and measured without a pre-existing trauma registry. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.',\n",
       " \"Background: Several studies have explored the effect of the presence of medical students on patient satisfaction. However, nearly all of these studies took place in hospitals where medical students had been involved in patient care for many years. Less is known about patients' perceptions of care in a hospital moving toward becoming a teaching facility with undergraduate students. No research has explored patient satisfaction before and after the introduction of medical students. Objective: To assess patient satisfaction as an indicator of quality of care (QoC) from the patients' perspective, before and after the presence of medical students in a general hospital setting. Methods: This observational, cross-sectional study was conducted at Hospital Universitario-Fundación Santa Fe de Bogotá (HU-FSFB) in Bogotá, Colombia. The study had two phases. In 2006, prior to HU-FSBF becoming a teaching hospital, 385 subjects were asked to fill out a closed-question questionnaire addressing patients' satisfaction and perception of QoC provided by attending physicians. During the second period in 2009, 372 patients answered the same questionnaire when medical students were involved in their care. Results: Patients' perceptions of QoC provided by attending physicians improved in five aspects when medical students were present: friendliness (p = 0.003), competence providing medical care (p = 0.049), quality of information provided (p = 0.025), amount of time spent with the patient (p < 0.001) and availability to personally provide care (p < 0.001). Overall patient satisfaction also significantly increased (p < 0.001). Conclusions: The presence of medical students does not negatively affect patients' perceptions of QoC, on the contrary, these results provide evidence of improved patient satisfaction in several aspects of care when medical students were involved. The relevance of this study lies in its unique way of comparing patient satisfaction before and after the introduction of medical students. This setting helps elucidate the real effect of the presence of medical students on patient satisfaction. © 2014 Informa UK Ltd.

Intensive silvopastoral systems (ISPS) combine fodder shrubs planted at high densities (&gt;10,000 plants ha-1), trees and pastures. Scaling-up such systems requires incentives to address financial and knowledge barriers. In Colombia, the strategy for scaling-up SPS has combined five elements. First, participatory research on real farms contributed to optimize SPS in different agroecosystems and strengthened a network of pilot farms open to research and peer-to-peer technology transfer. Second, capacity building, training, and outreach activities spread the principles of SPS among farmers, field workers, researchers, extension workers, and policy makers. Third, pilot projects explored the role of incentives such as Payment for Environmental Services (PES), technical assistance, soft loans and bonus prices, in spreading SPS. Fourth, successful pilot projects were instrumental in influencing the livestock sector as well as the public policy agenda. Fifth, currently, large-scale projects aimed at mainstreaming SPS are applying the lessons learned in order to achieve landscape-scale benefits, enhance climate change adaptation and mitigation, and introduce SPS products to green markets. Recently, innovation networks have contributed to speed up the adaptation of SPS in different environmental and socioeconomic contexts. © 2013 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.',\n",

       " \"Knowledge about the extent of irrigated land in Colombia is scarce because most irrigation is done informally and therefore not registered. Informal irrigation in Colombia has not been investigated, its national presence has not been identified, and its characteristics are still unknown. The present article aims to help fill this gap. Because of topographical and agricultural patterns, Andean informal irrigation is impossible to identify or characterize using standard methods. To provide information on the scale of informal irrigation systems in Colombia, their type, the users they serve, and the type of water sources they use, a large-scale partial inventory was made combining statistical analysis, questionnaires, interviews, and field trips. The findings indicate that informal irrigation is widespread in the country's mountainous zones, in a great diversity of environments, characterized by an equally great diversity of local uses and water-use strategies. This diversity has resulted from the coexistence of very different community and state institutions, posing challenges for planning and organizing water-resource management more efficiently and sustainably for producers, the government, and other stakeholders.\",\n",

Methods and Findings: The aims of this systematic review are to evaluate the characteristics (including the risk of bias assessment) of RCT conducted in LAC according to funding source. A review of RCTs published in 2010 in which the author's affiliation was from LAC was performed in PubMed and LILACS. Two reviewers independently extracted data and assessed the risk of bias. The primary outcomes were risk of bias assessment and funding source. A total of 1,695 references were found in PubMed and LILACS databases, of which 526 were RCTs (N = 73.513 participants). English was the dominant publication language (93%) and most of the RCTs were published in non-LAC journals (84.2%). Only five of the 19 identified countries accounted for nearly 95% of all RCTs conducted in the region (Brazil 70.9%, Mexico 10.1%, Argentina 5.9%, Colombia 3.8%, and Chile 3.4%). Few RCTs covered priority areas related with Millennium Development Goals like maternal health (6.7%) or high priority infectious diseases (3.8%). Regarding children, 3.6% and 0.4% RCT evaluated nutrition and diarrhea interventions respectively but none pneumonia. As a comparison, aesthetic and sport related interventions account for 4.6% of all trials. A random sample of RCTs (n = 358) was assessed for funding source: exclusively public (33.8%); private (e.g. pharmaceutical company) (15.3%); other (e.g. mixed, NGO) (15.1%); no funding (35.8%). Overall assessments for risk of bias showed no statistically significant differences between RCTs and type of funding source. Statistically significant differences favoring private and others type of funding was found when assessing trial registration and conflict of interest reporting. Conclusion: Findings of this study could be used to provide more direction for future research to facilitate innovation, improve health outcomes or address priority health problems. © 2013 Reveiz et al.\",\n",

       " 'Purpose: The aim of this paper is to empirically test the degree of influence of different knowledge sharing mechanisms (ICT-based, personal interaction-based, and embedded in management processes) on innovation capability (both on ideation and on innovation project management), as well as the influence of each first-level innovation capacity on company performance. Design/methodology/approach: A questionnaire was designed and addressed to the CEOs of the companies making up the target population (Spanish and Colombian medium-high and high technology firms with more than 50 employees and R&D activities). Structural equation modelling (SEM) based on partial least squares (PLS) was then applied to test the hypotheses drawn from the research. Findings: The results obtained show that knowledge sharing is a key issue in order to enhance innovation capability. With the exception of ICT-based knowledge sharing mechanisms (whose influence on the generation of new ideas is not statistically significant), all types of mechanism considered exert a significant impact both on ideation and on innovation project management (although their degree of relevance varies), and account for a great deal of variance in both constructs. Differences between countries arise when it comes to the influence of each first-level innovation capacity on company performance. Research limitations/implications: Traditional limitations of cross-sectional studies apply. Originality/value: The main contribution of this paper is to provide empirical evidence about the impact of knowledge sharing on innovation.

This is pursued by means of Innovation Indices, from which it is sought to identify regional and national special features, while allowing international comparative analysis, along the lines of the Oslo Manual. The work highlights the limitations of the information available to carry out the calculation of innovation indices as proposed in the recent literature on the subject. As an alternative, a methodology based on the Importance Value Indices (IVIs) is applied, which allows the calculation of new innovation performance indicators amenable to international comparisons. By applying multivariate statistical techniques, redundant information of a high number of variables is cleared to construct the IVIs; then, clustering and characterization of the different units of analysis is performed using a model that connects the variables refined.

But the paper emphasizes how these key local processes need support from higher levels of government and, very often, inter-municipal cooperation. Political or administrative boundaries seldom coincide with the areas where risk reduction needs to be planned and implemented. The paper also includes some discussion of innovations in national systems and funds to support local disaster risk reduction. © 2011 International Institute for Environment and Development (IIED).',\n",

       " 'Spatial distribution of sand bodies with the capacity of storing hydrocarbons follows complex patterns in reservoirs deposited in fluvial environments. Understanding this distribution is one of the most important factors to consider in the planning and management of any development strategy. Usually, a vertical distribution of the sand bodies is obtained from well logs, core description, and outcrops added with sedimentation and depositional modeling using different techniques. This information is transferred to 2D and 3D stratigraphic models in correlations and stratigraphic panels. Despite of model depuration and tuning with development information, uncertainty is still very high. The acquisition of 3D multi-component seismic information was defined as the tool to reduce this uncertainty in the volumetric distribution of sand bodies and their connectivity, to build the geometry of the reflectors with the wave field P, identifying the lithology and the presence of fluids. A pilot of this technology was designed in the Tenerife field (Middle Magdalena Valley Basin, Colombia) focused in obtaining information of the Mugrosa formation, of Oligocene age, composed basically by sandstone deposited in thin fluvial channels, primarily meandering. To obtain the planned outcome, a high density design (480,000 traces / km2) was developed to allow a sufficient relation signal/noise in the S wave. Non conventional field tests allowed the design of the parameters of charge from the energy source and the depth of the receptors. For the static solutions, multi-component \"upholes\" and the description of the shot point (SP) where tested to allow a geological model of the strata that could be related with the velocities of the P wave and S wave. The innovative design for the management of the combination of seismic attributes of the S wave and P wave has shown considerable advantages in the definition of the sand bodies in fluvial environments as heterogeneous as this case. This innovation opens immense possibilities for the development of similar fields in the Middle Magdalena Valley Basin as in other regions of the world with similar deposits.

This paper essays an approach to the impact that the strategies of the model of science, technology and innovation on the research activity in humanistic and social areas, in the frame of knowledge management. It will begin by taking into account critical theory and its conception of instrumental rationality, which will allow to show the problems that this kind of rationality poses to research in human and social sciences. The methodology of this research is qualitative and exploratory, developed through interviews directed to researchers in this area of knowledge, responsible for administration and management, to those who design the policies of public and private universities, and to governmental organizations. These interviews pretend to show their appreciations on the impact that these new policies and management strategies will have on human and social sciences. One of the conclusions of these study is that the new model of innovation, called triple helix, pretends that universities lead initiatives and finance the creation of technology based companies. This causes the researchers in human and social sciences to try to adapt themselves to the parameters set by this model, which leads to a blurring of their objects of study, and to the risk that the research on their area is limited to the narrow margins allowed by the commercialization of its results. © 2009 Escuela Interamericana de Bibliotecologia.

       " \"Current tendencies in strengthening intellectual property rights and the emergence of new scientific-technological fields (such as nanotechnologies, biotechnology, telematics and software development) have forced universities to acquire sufficient knowledge aimed at protecting their research results and fulfilling a leadership role within their regional settings so that they may generate competitive innovation strategies in alliance with other social agents. However, universities must promote ethical values, respectting and defending their countries' ecological and cultural heritage when intellectual property rights are being promoted. A model for managing universities' industrial property rights is thus proposed here; it is centred on patents so as to improve strategies contributing towards Latin-American universities' scientific and technological development and thereby contribute towards their countries' development. The model is one of the relevant results derived from the theoretical framework for research carried out by the team from 2003-2007 and from the empirical study carried out in two phases. The first phase consisted of a survey whose objective was to detect critical aspects regarding managing patents and licenses for universities in Colombia, Chile and Spain.

       " 'Colombia is the second largest world flower exporter. This leadership was achieved in part by the adaptation of imported technology. However, the special conditions of the production areas particular to the high tropics and increased international pressure require that the producers combine their efforts to increase productivity and competitiveness. To meet this challenge, the Colombian Association of Flower Exporters (Asocolflores) recently established the Colombian Centre for Innovation in Floriculture (Ceniflores) as a scientific, technological, independent, private, and non-profit institution. Research investment is long term and has proven high rates of return in other commodities. Due to limited funding, the flower sector needs adequate tools to manage it strategically. A research plan based on grower demand is the starting point for the Centre, which acts as \"virtual\" articulator between producers and research institutions, nationally and abroad. To achieve its objectives, Ceniflores has acquired a systems infrastructure built completely on Internet through a WEB-based architecture. This allows for information collection from multiple sources, its integration, and analysis. The information is available to different stakeholders through articulated networks (Business Web [B-Web]) built around the services offered, including access to documents, projects, research priority questionnaires, databases, and topic-based research networks, among others. The technology used is based on various open source applications, dramatically reducing time and cost to implement each of the services.

       " \"Objectives Designing and proposing alternative models for municipal and Departmental malaria control programmes based on evidence obtained concerning the process of malaria on the Colombian Pacific Coast and regarding key problems in the malaria control programme before and following health system reform in 1993. Methods An evaluative study was carried out, comparing the situation before and following the 1993 reform; model design was also compared. Control programme is understood as being the institution, the human group and administration in charge of control activities. The study was carried out in 2002 and 2003, in the Departments along the Colombian Pacific Coast; the four departmental capitals, 28 malarial and 5 control municipalities were included primary and secondary information was obtained by means of surveys and semi-structured interviews, community meetings and reviewing documentation in the secretariats of health, the Vector-borne disease control programme-VBDC, the Expanded Immunisation Programme-EIP, Health Promoting Entities-HPE, Subsidised Regime Administrators-SRA and Service-Providing Entities-SPE. Results The following results were obtained: 1. Illustrating and analysing malarial tendencies in the country and on the Pacific Coast, and the corresponding institutional transformations in the programme; 2. Characterising the control programme which existed before 1993; 3. Characterising departmental modes of decentralising the programme; 4. Identifying the effects of reforming the system and characterising control programme problems; 5. Comparing the programme with the Expanded Immunisation Programme (EIP); 6. Comparative analysis of the programme and identifying current gaps in management capability; 7. Actors' perceptions regarding the control programme; 8. Values and challenges for an innovative control programme; and 9. Designing a model for up-dating/adapting the control programme. Discussion Malaria control programmes' problems and weaknesses are frequently and inarticulately attributed to the lack of knowledge and management skill of personnel working in such programmes, the lack of an information and communication system or weaknesses in the municipalities or personnel. These factors may well have had an effect; however, a global and institutional approach leads to locating the programmes within a social, political and cultural context. This allows interpreting control programmes' current problems, amidst decentralisation and reform processes, and linking this interpretation to modelling and opening a space for innovation in such programmes. The study's main limitations spring from particularities regarding Pacific Coast control programmes and weakness in health information systems.\",\n",
       " 'Colombia is a poor country that has been plagued by ongoing violence for more than 120 years. During the 1940s, subversive terrorist groups emerged in rural areas of the country when criminal groups came under the influence of Communism, and were later transformed into contemporary groups, such as the Ejercito de Liberacion Nacional (ELN) or National Liberation Army and Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionares de Colombia (FARC) or Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia). Paramilitary terrorist groups emerged in response to subversive groups and were later transformed into contemporary groups, such as the Autodefensas Unidas de Colombia (AUC) or United Self-Defense Forces of Colombia. Terrorism has placed an enormous burden on modern Colombia. From 1995 to 2002, 9,435 people were killed by terrorism-related events, of which 5,864 were killed by subversive terrorist activities and 3,571 were killed by paramilitary terrorist activities. In 2002, at least nineteen attacks produced 10 or more casualties, of which 18 were bombings. In 2002, terrorists killed at least 12 mayors, 71 legislators, and internally displaced 300,000 persons from their homes. Since terrorist groups in Colombia are typically supported by drug manufacturing and trafficking, it has been difficult at times to distinguish violence due to terrorism from violence due to illicit drug trafficking. Terrorism has also had a major adverse effect on the economy, with restricted travel, loss of economic resources, and lack of economic investment. In addition to political, military, and commercial targets, terrorists have specifically targeted healthcare infrastructure and personnel. At the national and local levels, much emergency planning and preparedness has taken place for terrorism-related events. The Centro Regulador de Urgencias (CRU) or Emergency Regulation Center in Bogota plays a major role in coordinating local prehospital and hospital emergency response in the capital city and the national level where necessary. © World Association for Disaster and Emergency Medicine 2003.',\n",

This alternative must be supportedby an organized, selective and systematic procedure, such as the technological surveillance. Objective. To create a descriptive literature review regarding technological surveillance and a proposal for the technological surveillance method applied to the management of scientific activity of the Estudio Genetico de Enfermedades Complejas (EGEC – Genetic Study for Complex Diseases) research group. Methodology. Descriptive literature review. The following academic databases were consulted: Medline, SciELO, Ebsco e IEEE and Google Scholar search engine. The combination of keywords used when consulting the academic databases, was “vigilancia tecnológica/technological surveillance”, “salud/health”, “enfermedad/disease”, “ejemplos en salud”, “universidad” and “investigación”. Articles of the last five years are included, while articles that only had to deal with the results dissemination of technological surveillance exercises, were excluded. Based on the literature review analysis of results, a technological surveillance model is proposed which its objective is to manage the EGEC research group’s scientific activities. In order to do so, a stages, inputs and funds diagrams that integrated the surveillance model, were created. Thus, the already mentioned diagrams included a cancer pilot test as a validation strategy, and with the test results, the model was subjected to additional adjustments.Results. The Spanish standard UNE 166006:2011 created by the Spanish Association for Standarization and Certification (AENOR), was taken as an international reference whilst the program España y sus Regiones Intercambian Conocimiento con Antioquia (ERICA) and the methodology for technological surveillance Innovaciones a partir de la Vigilancia Tecnológica (InnoViTech), were taken as national referents. Additionally, conceptual stages, good practices for processes execution and defined budget for the development of technological surveillance, are established. The main components for the proposed model include needs identification, plus the planning, collection, auditing, analysis, documentation, and information spreading processes. Conclusions. The proposed model works as a foundation for developing a knowledge management strategy of a research group. Also, the model highlights the importance of climbing towards the usage of competitive intelligence systems within itself. [CarrilloZambrano E, Páez-Leal MC, Suárez JM, Luna-González ML.

       " 'El objetivo fundamental de esta investigación fue identificar las habilidades gerenciales para una cultura de innovación universitaria en instituciones de Colombia y Venezuela. Para cumplir con el objetivo, se estudiaron las bases teóricas de los autores Horth y Buchner (2009), Dyer, Gregersen y Christensen (2012) y Thomas (2010), entre otros. La metodología utilizada fue bajo el paradigma de investigación positivista y la investigación fue descriptiva con un diseño no experimental, transeccional y de campo. La población estuvo constituida por 60 docentes de cada universidad. Como instrumento para la recolección de datos se elaboró un cuestionario utilizando las categorías de respuestas de tipo Likert de 33 ítems, validado por siete expertos en el área. La confiabilidad del instrumento fue determinada por el método Alfa de Cronbach y presentó un 0,94 de confiabilidad. Los resultados de la investigación permiten evidenciar un bajo porcentaje tanto en las habilidades necesarias para ser innovadores, como en las habilidades de descubrimiento, por lo que se concluye la ausencia de las habilidades gerencialespara una cultura de innovación universitaria en instituciones de educación superior de Colombia y Venezuela.',\n",
       " 'Un aspecto que permite reconocer el fomento a la innovación en un país se corresponde con la cantidad de patentes solicitadas y otorgadas por este.

       "'The objective of this article was to evaluate the trends of scientific production in Economics with Colombian institutional affiliation during the period 2007-2019. A bibliometric analysis was carried out from the information registered in Scopus, through indicators of production, citation and collaboration and the quantitative exploratory analysis method, using the Biblioshiny, Vantage Point and VOSviewer software. The behavior of authors, journals and topics of higher publication visibility such as innovation and economic growth were studied. The main trends in the scientific production of Colombian authors with the highest publication in Scopus, present an annual average growth rate of 13%, in addition to publications in prestigious journals and important networks of national and international collaboration and predominance of coauthored publications (index of 1.8), expanding the connection not only at the level of higher education institutions, but through research institutes. The knowledge of the dynamics of disciplinary research in the study, contributed with information for the management of the scientific activity and the design of future research in Colombia. © 2021 Universidad de Antioquia.

The methodology is focused on the use of the expertons model, adequacy coefficient and forgotten effects theory. A questionnaire of 58 items about different innovation management areas is distributed to 14 beekeeper SMEs in the area of Boyacá-Colombia. The findings suggest that there are two specific actions that can improve innovation culture. These actions are related to marketing strategies and product innovation. The innovation strategy has a significant influence on the development of an innovative culture in the beekeeper SMEs; one must have a clear orientation to the innovation objectives in the marketing strategy, which is transferred to the product. Likewise, the utility of fuzzy methods for analysis when information is limited, subjective and scarce is highlighted. Finally, this research can be useful to practitioners and academics because the findings can serve as guidelines to understanding sources and enablers of innovation. In addition, the findings show how fuzzy methods help in contending with incomplete and subjective information, highlighting the meaning of the information rather than its measurement. © 2021, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.Cooperatives with financial activity stimulate the economy by providing economic resources to individuals and companies that cannot access the banking sector or prefer to belong to the cooperative sector. The objective is to analyze the economic and social impact of these cooperatives in the cities of Montería and Ibagué, Colombia, considering their determining attributes. The study is descriptive with a quantitative approach and 32 financial cooperatives participated. A questionnaire validated by expert judgment and a Cronbach’s Alpha coefficient of 0.815. The results show that the type of user, contracting modality, product offering, surplus growth, investments and advertising strategies, are some of the determining attributes in the management of the cooperatives with financial activity. It is concluded that these entities have an economic and social impact that is reflected in the quality of life of their associates, their families and their environment. Investing in technology and innovation is recommended to meet current and future challenges facing the cooperative sector. © 2021, Universidad del Zulia.

Seed systems encompassing all forest reproductive material (e.g., seeds, cuttings, stakes, and wildings), are key to ensuring that sufficient planting material with a diverse range of suitable species, adapted to local conditions and capable of persisting under a changing climate, is available for restoration projects. The ideal structure of a seed system integrates five components: seed selection and innovation, seed harvesting and production, market access, supply and demand, quality control, and an enabling environment. We propose 15 indicators to evaluate these key components and trial them by assessing national seed systems in 7 Latin American countries. We conclude that the indicators enable a straightforward assessment of the strengths and weaknesses of national seed systems, thus assisting governments to identify key areas for improvement and opportunities for horizontal learning. © 2021 by the authors.

This paper analyses the dynamics of STI in Colombia over the 1995–2019 period to determine its relationship with its most important determinants and its collateral relationship with economic growth as an input affecting different issues; this work takes into account the creation of the new ministry of science, technology and innovation (MSTI) and uses different time series techniques. According to the analysis, a positive relationship exists between investments in research and development, STI activities, and the independence and transparency of STI management by the new MSTI, which could generate higher productivity, technological change, economic growth and development. The results of the models also demonstrate the long-run relationship and short-run dynamics related to STI investment and research results and the importance of transparency and independence. It is important to establish adequate STI governance and allow new ministries to play an important role to achieve a society based on knowledge that produces relevant research, technology and innovation based on the needs and resources of the country. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.This paper aims to explore the variables that precede the intention and use of Mobile taxi booking (MTB) Apps as tools for taxi drivers to make contact with customers in the city of Medellin, Colombia. A literature review was carried out to select the variables that most effectively represent the analysed behaviour. The methodology was a quantitative study based on theories technology adoption such as the planned behaviour model, the model of the theory of technology adoption, and the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology. The data was collected in Medellin Colombia by means of surveying taxi drivers who use MTB Apps. The data analysis Partial Least Square (PLS) was used and the result more important is the evidence that taxi drivers take the positives factors that this technology provides to contact customers. © 2020 Elsevier LtdIn 2018, the Colombian Ministry of Health and Social Protection, in collaboration with the National Health Institute and the Pan American Health Organization, convened all actors associated with the National Tuberculosis Prevention and Control Program (PNPCT) and the National Science, Technology, and Innovation System to form a national network to coordinate operations research on tuberculosis (TB) in the country. Seven workshops were held and a consensus was reached to establish the National Network for Knowledge Management, Research, and Innovation in Tuberculosis in Colombia (TB Colombia Network). With more than 180 participants, a central node, and five regional nodes that bring together the country\\'s 37 territorial entities, the TB Colombia Network conducted four days of training in operations research in 2019, defining 65 priority research topics aligned with the strategic lines in the PNPCT: prevention and comprehensive care, with a focus on people affected by TB (41 topics in three modules); and political commitment, social protection, and support systems (24 topics in four modules). The peer comparison method was used for prioritization. The TB Colombia Network remains active and contributes to knowledge management aimed at eliminating TB in Colombia. It has helped make progress in building plans and implementing local operations research projects that generate scientifically validated results to strengthen the PNPCT and improve the care of TB patients. © 2021 Pan American Health Organization.

Concepts associated with high quality assurance, quality management, and excellence models in higher education were used as theoretical frameworks. There were three standards used: the Colombia decree 1330 of 2019, the ISO 9001 standard, and the Colombian Agreement 1 of 2020, which establishes the accreditation factors for higher education in Colombia. The results compared their characteristics and requirements. This allowed defining common processes and factors that guarantee the basic structure of an integrated quality management system while generating value for education programs. It is concluded that the ISO 9001 standard provides process management, innovation, and knowledge management. © 2021.

This has generated a series of management and evaluation processes of university scientific activity that constrain the understanding of the capacities generated by the institutions themselves. Even in the application of their instruments and policy models, productivity plateaus are achieved that raise questions about the possibility of sustainability and governance of these capacities. The chapter proposes a redefinition of the notion of science, technology, and innovation (STI) capabilities that go beyond the comparison of the relative competitive weight or value of one group with respect to another, but rather in terms of the heterogeneity between types of scientific and technological activity that universities carry out. For this purpose, we conceptualize the university as a complex adaptive system (CAS) in order to propose a methodology for evaluating the expected or planned results in the three missions—training, research, and extension—, in terms of the activation of governance mechanisms. In this context, this chapter focuses, exemplifies, and learns from the analysis and experience of modeling the STI capabilities of the Universidad del Valle de Colombia, through which we offer an alternative to strengthening the governance and management of the university mission. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.This chapter proposes the concept of Community-Based Innovation Ecosystem, as a framework for analysing communal and transformative innovation processes, particularly in territories affected by armed and social conflicts. In this way, it questions the conventional notion of innovation as a transactional process to open new markets in capitalism, towards a re-signified notion, as a sociotechnical process of collective transformation linked to actions carried out by grassroots organizations and communities. Therefore, the ecology of innovation is used as a biological metaphor for the studies of management and innovation. The case of the Guajuí River Community Council in Guapi—Colombia is described and analysed through the relationships between diverse, historically excluded actors through collaboration in post-conflict or post-agreement contexts. Finally, a series of conclusions are presented regarding the interdependent dynamics of the actors in Guapi, their limitations, opportunities, and future lines of action. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to examine the enablers and barriers influencing international knowledge transfer at the team-level in the context of product innovation within an emerging-market multinational enterprise (EMNE) in the insurance industry. Design/methodology/approach: The research applies an exploratory case study design considering an emerging-market multinational insurance company headquartered in Colombia. Four subsidiaries (El Salvador, Chile, Argentina and Colombia) and the Corporate Office (headquarter) served as the research sites. It also adopts an interpretive research approach providing a grounded theory framework linking international knowledge transfer and product innovation. Findings: The empirical findings emphasize the central role played by the enablers (i.e. shared vision, empathy and knowledge sources) in facilitating international knowledge transfer, which, in turn, enhances product innovation. More important, however, is the detailed explanation that the paper provides regarding the enablers’ microfoundational antecedents in terms of key activities that are performed at the team-level. Research limitations/implications: The grounded theory framework was constructed using data collected in a single firm associated with a particular industry and regional context. The study only considered a single aspect of knowledge management (i.e. knowledge transfer). Other aspects of knowledge management systems, such as knowledge creation and knowledge application, should be used for explaining product innovation in EMNEs more comprehensively. Practical implications: The study suggests a set of enabling conditions and activities that should be adopted by managers of EMNEs to improve international knowledge transfer with the aim of triggering product innovation. This includes the design of strategies for strengthening empathy among geographically dispersed teams by providing opportunities for regular live videoconferences among team members aimed at building close bonds, fostering trust and creating a sense of belonging in which participants get to know each other better and to establish a shared vision and a set of guiding principles and commitments for how the team will work. These suggestions are particularly important today when several multinational enterprises (MNEs) have been forced to rearrange their workplace by replacing face-to-face interactions with virtual work dynamics due to the COVID-19 crisis. Originality/value: Previous studies have confirmed that international knowledge transfer positively influences MNEs’ innovative performance. However, no studies have been conducted linking both variables in the context of EMNEs in Latin America in the service sector. The research tries to fill this gap. Besides, the paper introduces empathy as a novel enabler for international knowledge transfer and a moderator able to diminish the negative effect that cultural differences and geographical barriers have on the knowledge transfer process. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.At present, it has been shown that very few SMEs have knowledge of the Business Process Management BPM system, which offers a series of strategies and benefits oriented towards processes, using technology systems in terms of information management, evaluating the organizational culture and covering all the operational and business processes of the organization, in order to increase productivity and competitiveness, guaranteeing continuous improvement of internal processes following their life cycle, where they are documented, analyzed, improved, are implemented, and are monitored and controlled. In this study, the BPM culture of an information technology SME, called Management and Quality, was evaluated based on the study carried out by Jan Vom Brocke, in which 4 values are established, which are: customer orientation, excellence, responsibility, and teamwork, called CERT values, the survey adapted to the context of the company and Colombia was applied; As a result, opportunities for improvement in excellence were found represented by the dimensions of continuous improvement and innovation, and in the formal structures, dimension of teamwork, recommendations were made for these findings. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.Countries with emerging economies such as Mexico, Argentina, Chile, and Colombia are lagging behind China, India, and others in Knowledge-Intensive Business Services (KIBS), due to their organizational inertia to sense and seize new market opportunities and achieve new and innovative ways of competitive advantage. The objective of this paper is to analyze the dynamic capabilities needed to enhance the management model in KIBS in emerging economies context. The study is carried out by gathering and reviewing successful experiences extracted from the literature on management models for KIBS in developed countries, leading emerging economies, and Latin American countries. As a result, the relevance of this type of service is established in some of the most developed economies, as well as the capabilities that have been strengthened in leading emerging countries, such as China and India, to finally propose the actions that Latin American countries can undertake. Main results show the need to embed absorptive cutting-edge knowledge capabilities in KIBS organizations, to consolidate, reinforce, and innovate in processes reflected in competitive services. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.Grassroots innovation generates possibilities for the informal and collective production of the territory that the city itself denies, from bottom-up solutions for sustainable development and consumption, which respond to the local situation, interests, and values of the communities involved. This paper aims to identify how grassroots innovation practices take place and are shaped in ‘El Faro’, a self-built settlement at the urban border of the city of Medellín; and how these have allowed the social transformation of health and well-being. This was done from a qualitative approach with an interpretative scope, under the case study methodology. ‘El Faro’ is a space built by its inhabitants, in a process that they have called \"dignity and resistance\", becoming the promoter of what we identify as four ‘grassroots innovation practices’ developed around three main issues: community water management, artistic training and the creation of community public spaces. This process has allowed them, from the capacity of agency, to understand their poverty situation and face it, modifying the conditions that reproduce it and responding to unsatisfied basic needs, based on innovative solutions that guarantee conditions of life with dignity and well-being. Likewise, it generates mechanisms that reduce inequality because the community becomes the main driving agent for the construction of the city and the transformation of the health-disease process, through its community assets. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons LtdKnowledge is important to the extent it is used. This knowledge use assumes that people know about findings resulting from the investigations that generate it. Production and mobilization of knowledge are not new, nevertheless, such production and mobilization have occurred in developed countries from works and products research. In Colombia, in accordance with the Ministry of Science, Technology and Innovation, 5.772 groups of investigation are recognized by different institutions, and 16.799 researchers. The purpose of this article is to determine what are the means used by researchers in Colombia, to disseminate the results of their investigations. The methodology incorporates primary data, through a validated instrument by experts. Those results confirm that Colombian researchers still use traditional means to spread out such results. Very few of them use the emerging Information and Communication Technology for that purpose. Thus, an opportunity emerges for Researchers regarding the use of ICT in knowledge mobilization. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.Purpose: This study provides empirical evidence on the innovations that Nonprofit Organizations (NPOs) in Colombia have implemented within their own management to address social problems which are the object of their institutional mission. Design/methodology: This research is based on information obtained from a survey applied to executives of Colombian NPOs. Multiple linear regression models were developed to check the partial effect of the set of independent variables (Organizational and Social Innovation) over the dependent variable (Organizational Performance). Main Components Analysis was applied to grouping the considered variables. Findings: Empirical evidence indicates that Colombian NPOs are innovative organizations that advisedly follow management strategies for this purpose. Colombian NPOs have been innovating for their disposition to tackle the social problems implicated in their institutional mission. Evidence indicates that the main components derived from NPOs\\' organizational and social innovations are grouped into four: NPO innovation actions to adapt to the environment; internal innovation actions to improve NPO\\'s performance; variables related with NPO innovation actions to improve their relations with external agents; innovation actions aimed at improving the management of social interventions associated with the mission of the NPOs and the management of institutional projects. Research limitations/implications: The field work only used the survey technique to obtain the information and only assessed the perception of one of the directors of each of the NPOs participating in the study in terms of both the actions of organizational innovation such as social innovation and organizational performance. Therefore, the study undoubtedly presents bias in that perception. The technique used for the selection of the sample of the participants was a non-probabilistic sampling, which implies bias in the information and therefore, limitation for the generalization of the results to other contexts. The geographical location of the administration of the NPOs was restricted to Bogota and surrounding municipalities. Originality/value: An analysis of the relationship between social and organizational innovations with organizational performance in NPOs was carried out in the context of an emerging economy, where the subject has been very little studied and much less with principal component analysis. This in order to contribute to a better understanding of the subject. © 2021. All Rights Reserved.Purpose: This paper investigates the impact of adopting quality management standards like ISO9001 on a firm\\'s performance and the mediator role of human capabilities within firms in this relationship. The article analyses this mediator effect in the context of an emerging economy that set a policy reform aimed at increase ISO adoption and with a large share of informal labour markets. Design/methodology/approach: This study implements a quantitative approach, applying a Difference in Differences-DiD model with a Propensity Score Matching on fixed effect panel data analysis of a sample of certified and non-certified firms using firm-level data obtained from the national statistics office of Colombia. This methodology allows having comparable groups before the policy implementation. It reduces differences in observable characteristics and controls for parallel trends in primary outcomes before the policy reform. Findings: The research findings suggest that after Colombian policy reform of the quality system (2006), firms that adopted ISO 9001 certification increased innovation (5.2%), labour productivity (4.6%), sales (5.7%) and wages (4.9%). Furthermore, it shows that the share of permanent workers is an essential mediator in adopting quality programs. Adopters firms with a large percentage of temporary workers weaken their initial investment in quality infrastructure. Research limitations/implications: This research does not consider one key aspect. This is the lack of information about the organizational culture inside Colombian organizations that is related to a successful implementation of Quality Management standards like ISO 9001. However, it does not affect the conclusion about the mediation effect of human capital in the relationship between ISO 9001 and firm performance. Practical implications: The study covered all the Colombian manufacturing firms with ten or more employees. It provides critical insight for managers to value implementing ISO 9001 certification and appropriately put attention to enhancing their firms\\' human capital in emerging economies. Also, a policy implication of the paper is that governmental efforts to strengthen quality infrastructure in emerging economies should also include steps to increase a firm\\'s investment in human capital. Originality/value: This study provides further support for government policies to strengthen firms\\' incentives to adopt modern management practices. The strong effects of implementing these management practices on sales, productivity and innovation have been identified. Furthermore, the investments in quality infrastructure must be accompanied by investment in human capital and workforce stability. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.Introduction. Surgical management of chest wall lesions with resection and reconstruction with prosthetic material has been increasing, due to advances in surgical techniques and surgeon’s experience, as well as innovation and characteristics of prosthetic materials. They allow wide resections of the wall, guaranteeing greater skeletal stability, less alteration of respiratory mechanics, and better aesthetic results. Methods. The experience in the CardioVID clinic, Medellín, Colombia, between the years 2015 and 2019, is presented through a retrospective review of eight cases that underwent resection of benign lesions of the chest wall and reconstruction with prosthetic material. Results. An adequate evolution of the patients was found, with a good aesthetic and functional result, with adequate control of the disease, without reports of complications or recurrence in follow-up. Discussion. An adequate technique allows the reconstruction of these defects with minimal complications and low prosthesis extraction rates, ending with excellent functional and cosmetic results. With our experience, we can conclude that the proper choice of patients who are good candidates for surgical management, a good surgical technique, and an experienced staff are crucial to achieve good results in terms of lung function and aesthetics results, in addition to obtain survival under the established parameters after achieving an R0 resection. © 2021, Asociacion Colombiana de Cirugia.

Through the means of community identified problems, its main goal was to promote community associative capabilities and socioenvironmental appropriation of territories in order to generate alternative methods of sustainable and sustained development. Methods such as People-centered design, Participatory Action Research and Environmental Education were applied. Results showed that social actors managed to devise, drive and deliver innovative and feasible solutions which made it possible to contribute to the objective of sustainable development and overall pollution reduction in the area. The design applied herein allowed for a collective vision to be built in order to direct community potentials and propose new forms of governance, in relevant elements of economic, social and environmental development of the rural sector. The study concludes that community efforts and their organizational capacity permitted the implementation of a social innovation model focused around the use of solid waste. This model can be replicated in rural areas at the national level, thus contributing towards the mitigation of adverse effects related to anthropic activities. Finally, community actions can influence public policies and participate in the overall transformation of local environment and territories. © 2021, CEDDAR.

Endogenous growth and integrationist organizational culture were the theoretical approaches followed by this study. The methodology was de-veloped in two stages: first, the relationship between innovation, human capital and production level was addressed from a longitudinal statistical analysis of the Survey of Technological Development and Innovation in the Manufacturing Industry; afterward, involvement and adaptability factors of the Denison Model were measured through the direct application of a survey to companies in the plastics sector. We found that the impact of staff skills on production is significant and that such impact increases when observing staff with higher education attainment. Besides, involvement and adaptability factors were located in intermediate areas in which the efficient use of production resources is moderate. © 2021, Universidad Nacional de Colombia.

For this exercise of the impact of the four components of business development, 100,000 iterations were defined (Monte Carlo method), which represents a large amount of random data on the information parameters collected and accumulated to estimate a probability distribution of the success that the companies would have in real life, having as input the specific information of financial management,knowledge management, innovation processes and marketing. The results reflect that business development is influenced by four components in the following proportion: Financial Management (30%), Knowledge Management (25%), Innovation Processes (25%) and Marketing (20%). © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.This study aimed to recognize trends and challenges in the management of public and private sport organizations in Colombia. We realized a theoretical analysis from the literature around the subject and a content analysis with information provided in a panel of recognized experts in the area. The results indicate innovation, the incorporation of information and communication technologies, the organizational change management, the need to strengthen the training profiles of managers, inter-institutional relations and networking, as some of the most challenging important for managers. It is a starting point for the design of plans in organizations and plans of training for managers. © 2021 Sport TK.International development projects face uncertainty challenges more often than other projects. The strategic prospective approach is based on understanding the future and accepting uncertainties. This theory is presented as an appropriate methodology for this type of projects. This study presents the case study of a development project designed and executed according to this discipline. The project involved implementing an innovative model of higher technical education and employability for low-income young people in the Department of Cauca (Colombia). The results show that despite the region\\'s circumstances and the overall context, future problems were identified in advance, and this had a positive impact on the project. From international development, project management can learn flexibility to deal with the uncertainty and participative processes required for managing stakeholders, and the strategic prospective approach can be a good alliance in this challenge. © 2020Sedimentation is an important issue that has been studied for the watershed of reservoirs, since it increases operational costs of hydropower installations, reduces the life expectancy, and compromises the generation capacity due to volume reduction. This work addresses the implementation of Chivor’s Life Extension Project (CLEP), developed in order to extend the life of La Esmeralda reservoir, which is used for power generation in Colombia. Sediment dynamics studies are first described and connected to the need of the AES Corporation to extend the life expectancy of the Chivor Hydropower Project. The geotechnical and hydraulic designs are described and the main considerations and tools for the execution of such a project are addressed. The construction of the new intake system was developed under favorable geomorphological, geological, and hydrogeological conditions, and the project is being developed without affecting the current operation. Such an innovative project is the first of its class in Colombia and goes from studies of sediment transport and sediment management strategies in the watershed to the design and construction of new intakes, in order to extend the life of an existing 1000-MW (6% of Colombia’s demand) powerplant for 50 more years, contributing to a sustainable energy supply for the future. © 2020 by the authors.

Based on Bass\\'s technology diffusion model, this paper analyzes the impact of current incentives, considered in Law 1715 of 2014, on investment in photovoltaic solar energy in Colombia. The main results of the large-scale project scenario show an installed capacity 1542 MW of solar PV by 2030, which makes it the most profitable and the one with the highest growth potential. The contribution in this paper is to survey the Colombian electricity market potential on the inclusion of solar PV. © 2020 Universidad de Antioquia.

The main purpose of the research is to demonstrate the strengths, advantages and disadvantages of each construction system and once the real results were obtained to be able to make the application in professional practice for the management of the works and the execution of higher education projects, in this way the new construction processes are potentialized as a contribution to the development of architecture and innovation in Colombia, which is a country that is seeking to enter new methodologies and construction systems which must be aligned with the management issues that are being applied in the construction guild. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.This article aims to describe the organizational learning conditions and practices that promote innovation in medium-sized companies. The research is based on logical positivism using a descriptive and quantitative approach. The sample is composed of medium-sized companies from the municipality of Valledupar, Colombia. A survey and a questionnaire with a Likert-type scale are employed for data collection. The questionnaire\\'s content validity is estimated by expert judgment. The reliability is determined using the Cronbach\\'s alpha coefficient. The results indicate that the companies analyzed promote learning processes through organizational culture, training, and the articulation of competitive strategy. In conclusion, companies implement the generation and selection of ideas as an innovation management practice. However, they present difficulties in managing resources for the development of innovative projects. © 2020 Centro de Informacion Tecnologica.

Several management and technological options with enteric methane mitigation potential have been evaluated and their scaling is anticipated to contribute toward achieving GHG emission reduction targets in the framework of the Paris Agreement. Yet, widespread adoption of promising mitigation options remains limited, raising questions as to whether envisaged emission reduction targets are achievable. Using findings from local studies, we explore the mitigation potentials of technologies and management practices currently proposed to mitigate enteric methane emissions from cattle production systems in the higher emitting countries of Latin America. We then discuss barriers for adopting innovations that significantly reduce cattle-based enteric methane emissions and the major shifts in policy and practice that are needed to raise national ambitions in the high emitting countries. Using the latest science and current thinking, we provide our perspective on an inclusive approach and re-imagine how the academic, research, business and public policy sectors can support and incentivize the changes needed to raise the level of ambition and achieve sustainable development goals (SDG), considering actions from the farm to the national scale. © Copyright © 2020 Arango, Ruden, Martinez-Baron, Loboguerrero, Berndt, Chacón, Torres, Oyhantcabal, Gomez, Ricci, Ku-Vera, Burkart, Moorby and Chirinda.An innovative research-based technology has been applied for the first time in Colombia to improve the navigability of the Magdalena river in a zone of the city of Barrancabermeja, Department of Santander. The result of installation of the submerged vane technology demonstrated its effectiveness in sediment management and motivated its further use as a solution to problems of erosion, scour and meander evolution, which are common occurrence in the rivers of the country. Since this 1991 installation, more than 18 projects have been completed and the technical effectiveness of the system has been improved. Compared to traditional solutions, the results demonstrate beneficial economic impacts due to shorter execution times, reduction in annual maintenance costs, and diminished environmental impacts. Characteristics of design and construction and results obtained from five projects are described that are representative of the diversity of conditions and difficulties for the application of this technology in Colombia. Lessons learned for adaptation by river management authorities are derived from the study. © 2020 by the authors.This paper addresses the geomorphic characterization and classification of large rivers in a framework of scarce information. This is inspired by the River Styles Framework with some modifications that make the process more straightforward and accessible to practitioners and more applicable to large basins, while reducing the subjective, expert-based inputs, as the process is now more systematic. To this aim, it utilizes innovative criteria and some computer-aided procedures and tools based on GIS, Excel and Python. This approach sheds light on the character and the behavior of rivers, which is key to informing planning, management and restoration. The application to the Magdalena River (Colombia) illustrates the characterization and classification process and the type of results, which ultimately highlight the great geomorphic diversity of that river. The process is applicable to many other rivers worldwide. © 2020 by the authors.

Case studies explore work to increase understanding of natural hazards and disaster preparedness. Puerto Rico offers innovative examples of reflection on memories of Hurricane Maria by primary students and university undergraduates. From Brazil comes description of work in schools to develop curriculum skills and research competencies at high-school level. The Brazilian scheme encourages schools to become producers of knowledge rather than reproducers of centrally disseminated information. Another case study focuses on efforts to protect university buildings in Colombia. The rich landscape of policy, practice and experience in South America and the Caribbean is informed by a model of the three pillars of Comprehensive School Safety: 1. Safe Learning Facilities, 2. School Disaster Management, and 3. Risk Reduction and Resilience Education. © 2019The local knowledge is constituted in the basis for decision-making and is an important part of the livelihood of rural families. Knowledge of cocoa crop management practices takes an essential role in the producers’ resilience capacity to face and adapt to changing environments in the productive, social and environmental level. It was carried out a study in the Macarena-Guaviare region, Colombia to evaluate the level of knowledge of cocoa producers, to analyze how this knowledge is affected by familiar, organizational or productive variables, and to determine the formation needs. To determine the level of knowledge, it was proposed a methodology called “Cacota test” which was applied and validated by cocoa producers (n = 189). It was evaluated the knowledge about the links (a. Crop design, b. Clones, c. Soil fertility, d. Pruning, e. Pests and diseases management, f. Good agricultural practices, g. Harvest, h. Post-harvest, i. Transformation, j. Marketing, k. Associativity, l. Institutionality). By means of a cluster analysis, producers were typified according to their level of knowledge and it was made a principal component analysis (PCA) to visualize the relation between the links and types of producers. It was elaborated a Cocoa Knowledge Index (CKI) and the links with greater and lesser strength regarding management level were identified. Also, the variables which influence the CKI were identified using a linear regression model. Positive correlations were found between the links: a. Clones and Soil fertility, b. Pruning and good agricultural practices, c. Pruning and pests and diseases management. The typologies were affected by the level of education, level of associativity and cultivated area. The local knowledge was not significantly related to age and gender. The proposed methodology made possible to determine the level of local knowledge of cocoa crop management practices. The institutions or people responsible for the formation of cocoa producers in the Macarena-Guaviare region should focus on crop design, clones, soil fertility, harvest, post-harvest and transformation links. © 2020 Elsevier LtdThis article presents the results of research work realized in a higher education institution in the department of Boyacá, Colombia, where it is necessary consult the innovation sources, its interaction between company, state, and academy, to subsequently identify the current position through the VRIO matrix and resulting in the innovation compass.

For example, a series of technological strategies allows bought countries to guarantee a reduction of the environmental impact of traditional construction technologies. Therefore, these actions try to answer the problems in the design of dwellings in Latin America. However, the construction sector reduced productivity and limited innovation in business. Some of the technological management processes in the social housing construction sector only consider the implementation of clean technologies tangentially. This situation is mainly because of general policies since they do not consider different local contexts. It is thenworth asking: What impact do the processes of transfer of clean technologies have on social housing in Brazil and Colombia? This systematic review was carried out on scientific papers indexed by the science database from 2013 to 2019. The PRISMA method was applied to this review with an aim to propose a conceptual model for the transfer of clean technology in the production of social housing in Brazil and Colombia. Finally, we identify that the impact of clean technologies transfer on social housing is very low in these two countries. © 2020 by the authors.This study aims to validate the relationships between the dynamic capabilities in the operation of small and medium enterprises (SMEs) that constitute the Nature Tourism Cluster (also known as \"ecotourism\") in Colombia, through the application of surveys to managers and owners of hotels and lodgings of rural tourism, travel agencies, tour guides and operators, bars, restaurants and tourist transport centers, whose data obtained, support our hypothesis that the dynamic capacities of absorption, adaptation and innovation influence the functioning of SMEs, while at the cluster level, there is an positive relationship in the interaction of absorption and innovation capabilities. The greatest contribution of our research consists in the development of an empirical study that is based on the main contributions of the dynamic capabilities promoted by Teece (absorption, adaptation and innovation), and that allowed to determine the degree of influence that managers have to take decisions and undertake sustainable ecotourism actions, both at the SME level and at the cluster level. For this reason, our research provides a better understanding of how dynamic capabilities operate at the individual commercial level, as well as at the cluster level, in the combination of absorption, adaptation and innovation capabilities to foster new sustainability narratives and maintain sustainable ecotourism. Our results also point out the limitations and challenges for the sustainable tourism sector in Colombia. © 2020 by the authors.Rational energy consumption in large buildings depends on both the users\\'consumption culture and the management systems implemented. In Colombia, few buildings have an energy management system characterized by its adaptability to the user and with a certain degree of intelligence. Thus, this document describes the summarized research process for the development of an Internet of Things (IoT) system, which has been designed to promote an intelligent lighting service in an academic environment. The IoT system orchestrates a series of sensors, monitoring systems and controlled actions, all based on the principle of making the system functions and consumption records available in real-time, via web services. The devices used are \\'Things\\' with improved functionality, becoming \"Smart Things\"within the IoT paradigm. Methodologically, an experimental process was followed, linking the development of electronic tools, the construction of services, and the development of interfaces for a pleasant user experience. Research contributes to two essential areas: intelligent buildings, through the intelligent adaptation of an environment; and sustainability and eco-innovation, since the system provides appropriate information for environmental education, in terms of real-time energy consumption, that impacts directly on the fair-use culture of a service expensive for the environment. Copyright: This is an open access article distributed under licenseIn the present work, we try to find the determinants of innovation capabilities in the health care organizations. Firstly, the structural and measurement model was elaborated to account the relations between the latent variables and the manifest ones. Secondly, the model was identified; subsequent to this, we proceeded to calculate the adjustment indexes and using some techniques of multivariate methods. Then, we analyzed the areas of the model that did not fit properly to intervene them and thus achieve an optimal adjustment. We proposed some hypothesis that allowed us to prove positive causal relationships between the Innovation Capabilities and the variables. We had 283 observations extracted from the network of high complexity hospitals in Colombia during the years 2016 and 2017. A model with a significant adjustment that would account for the triggers of Innovation Capabilities in health care organizations was obtained. Finally, the positive impact of knowledge management, human resource management, management capabilities, organizational culture, and some factors associated with the health care Organizations on Innovation Capabilities was demonstrated. © 2020, Revista de Metodos Cuantitativos para la Economia y la Empresa.

Allowing an organizational climate in which employees engage as internal entrepreneurs can serve as a conduit for in-house generation of innovations. In order to sustain such innovative activity within a firm, corporate entrepreneurship integrates intentional and visible organizational conducts to engage employees in entrepreneurial behaviours that allow for revitalization and strategic renewal. In an understanding that an organizational climate influences employees behaviors, studies have found that certain organizational dimensions can increase employees\\' perceptions of organizational support that elicit their willingness to pursue entrepreneurial initiatives. In emerging and developing economies prevails a disparity on the capacity of firms to create an organizational climate that taps into the entrepreneurial behaviors of employees. In Latin America, even though many companies develop some type of innovation, the innovative performance of many firms lags significantly behind that of developed economies. The aim of this paper is to assess the perception of employees on five key dimensions in ten Latin American firms located in Colombia, Ecuador, Mexico, and Honduras from five different industries. To this end, the Corporate Entrepreneurship Climate Instrument (CECI) was applied to assess (1) top management support, (2) employee autonomy, (3) rewards/reinforcement, (4) time availability, and (5) organizational boundaries. Results from multivariate analysis show that the role of top managers within the company appears as one of the main inhibitors to entrepreneurial behaviour, highlighting the need for improving top management\\'s sensitivity to supporting entrepreneurial activity of employees. Findings also reveal that employees perceive a weakness of organizational resources and incentives to entrepreneurial behavior. The practical implication of this exploratory study is that as long as traditional managerial conducts are not transformed, entrepreneurial individuals will not flourish in detriment of higher innovative organizational performance. © 2020 Academic Conferences and Publishing International Limited.

A quantitative and correlational methodology was used, based on an exploratory factor analysis and a confirmatory factor analysis. Information was collected with a questionnaire based on the Likert scale and a survey was applied to a sample of 411 students. The results showed the importance of self-efficacy, userfriendliness and perceived utility as drivers of learning processes and acceptance of the value of technology and innovation management. However, there are still some gaps in the training processes, such as lack of subjects, contents and sufficient information around the subject. It is concluded that relevant training in this field can be decisive to increase the employability of management professionals and to increase the contribution to the improvement of business competitiveness and sustainability. © 2020 All Rights ReservedObjectives To evaluate the habitability conditions of dwellings and their impact on human health in Mochuelo Bajo, sector in Bogota Colombia, within the framework of the Healthy Habitat project led by the Housing, Habitat and Social Innovation Center (CENVIS). Methods A tool was developed for field data collection about socioeconomic and healthy conditions of housing units and families assigned to the project. After which, a quantitative analysis was performed in order to answer to the stablished objective. Results It was found through the tool application: a) inadequate supply, storage and management of drinking water, b) poor disposal of human excreta and solid household waste, c) poor management of rainwater use, d) inadequate coexistence with domestic and consumption animals, e) interior air pollution and f) self-construction systems with unsafe materials and without technical advice. Conclusions In the Mochuelo Bajo sector there were found generalized shortcomings related to an inadequate supplying and usage of potable water, a wrong disposition of human excreta and of solid household waste. At the same time, there are shortcomings in terms of rainwater and coexistence with animals, both domestic and for consumption. © 2020, Universidad Nacional de Colombia.

The qualitative approach was from the confrontation of the theory with the specific conditions of the object addressed (its characteristics and needs) which allowed the design of the model. The quantitative data approach was statistical. The population corresponds to the educational actors (teachers, students, administrative and management) of the medicine program, a total of 2139. The sampling was stratified and to determine the size of each of the stratum, took into account the population variances of the same and opted to use the criterion of Neyman\\'s Affixation. For data analysis, they were presented in frequency distribution tables, with range and confidence interval measurements at 95 % (CI-95 %). Also, to observe the relationship between the variables (aspects) and the actors, a simple correspondence analysis was performed. All information was processed in the R-CRAN program. Seven surveys were designed which were validated by experts in higher education, who qualified coherence with the objectives of the study, the shape of the instrument and the clarity of the questions. The analysis of theories on intellectual capital allowed the design of the systemic-dynamic model of management of intellectual capital for the quality of institutions of higher education-SIDIGCIES, is based on three theories: Theory of dynamic capacities in the business world, of Teece, Pisano and Shuen; And, Theory of knowledge creation of Nonaka and Takeuchi. The guidelines of the National Accreditation Council (CNA) of Colombia were also taken into account for both programs and institutions. It is structured by four dynamic subsystems: human talent, research and innovation, academic administration and Social recognition. Its name is due to the way the management of intellectual capital in the IES must work, which requires an interconnected system, whose relationship is developed in a dynamic and non-static way when it is constantly moving, constantly improving and Adjustments, in constant internal interaction in each one of its elements and with the external medium. It is precisely the continuous interaction between the members of the Organization and other external agents in a careful way, which leads to the creation of new knowledge. Around the dynamic subsystems the elements that make possible the promotion and distribution of knowledge are undulating, they are: tacit knowledge, explicit knowledge, organizational knowledge and inter-organizational knowledge. In turn, the dynamic subsystems are influenced by four elements that directly affect their integral behavior and the achievement of the objectives of the IES. Without them, is not possible effective management of intellectual Capital; these are: Financial condition, national and international context, ethical-Legal aspects and physical infrastructure and material resources. The validation of the model in a medical program showed the relevance of SIDIGCIES, with the national and international requirements established for the accreditation of programs and institutions. We achieved the design of 92 indicators for measurement, distributed in each of the subsystems with this is possible a comprehensive analysis of their reality and not fractionally. Seven instruments were also designed for the actors of the teaching-learning process duly validated, counting in this way with reliable tools of measurement of the management of the CI SIDIGCIES, that allows the systematic and interdisciplinary study, oriented to identify the intellectual resources to share, employ, keep and protect them at the individual, organizational, social and global levels. It is a tool that will orient the proper management of the CI, will motivate the recognition of the value of the human talent for the production of the intangibles that there are produced, towards the recognition of the quality by the society and the State. © 2020 Centro Interamericano de Investigaciones Psicologicas y Ciencias Afines.This article attempts to extend the debate on open innovation and public policies in developing countries. It presents the case of the public policy of Competitiveness, Science, Technology and Innovation CSTI in the department of Valle del Cauca, Colombia, analyzing the dynamics and network structure of the open innovation actors in the policy according to breadth and depth relations using a network methodology. The results showed that the relationship between the actors needs to be expanded from breadth to a depth relation. Consequently, the policy\\'s network in the region holds important implications for the management of open innovation and public policies where heterogeneous actors interact. © Centar for Quality.This article analyses the presence of sustainable tourism and social entrepreneurship in various Colombian regions, which are currently undergoing post-conflict management, in order to establish a baseline against which to monitor and assess future tourism initiatives and growth. The study was done using a qualitative methodology that included semi-structured interviews with tourism actors, with four main dimensions: social, economic, political, and environmental. The research revealed that, after the signing of the peace treaty, tourism in previously conflict-affected regions significantly increased due to the growth of privately owned tourism enterprises focused on profit making. However, levels of sustainable development, community involvement, and social entrepreneurship initiatives remain low; hence, the tourism value chain needs to be strengthened with local community involvement in order to reconstruct the social fabric. This can be done with social entrepreneurial practice, through sustainable tourism, or Sustainable Social Tourism, considered an innovative model that empowers communities and contributes to peace building. © Common Ground Research Networks, Luz Dary González-Cortés, Soraya Husain-Talero, All Rights Reserved.The challenges that modern companies face in a competitive environment where innovation is the cross-cutting issue of their daily practices, providing SMEs, in particular, the need to internalize new management schemes that allow them to formally redefining their strategies in order to promote of innovation within their organizations. Hence the objective of proposing a strategic management model for innovation SMEs according to their needs, capabilities and resources. For this, a documentary study was carried out, in which information from scientific articles, books, dissemination magazines and websites was reviewed and collected to later interpret and analyze the information obtained with a proactive scope using as principal authors: Sánchez, Cervantes and Peralta (2016); Pérez (2014); Aguilera (2010); Johnson, Scholes and Whittington (2006), among others. It concludes with the design of a strategic addressing model that articulates innovation to the daily practices of SMEs, thereby achieving better management impact. © 2020, Universidad del Zulia.

To do so, a descriptive case study is developed applying a valuation method based on an existing model. This way, a maturity level was determined for the studied capacity. This valuation is built with primary information taken from semi-structured interviews to the directors and administrative staff in the health care provider facilities. This information was compared to the policies, strategies, processes, resources and other secondary information provided by the health care provider itself. The results thus obtained show that the innovation capacity in this IPS is heterogeneous as the dimensions thereof are not uniform, and fluctuate between extreme ends. It is due to the fact that the innovation activities in the IPS are processes requiring some formalization and strengthening. Possibly what they need is an innovation management system that enables to prioritize the problems and focus the efforts in specific action lines. © 2019 Pontificia Universidad Javeriana.

A review of the state of the art of the management tool is made to know its components and be able to design a model that fits the experimental farm of the Universidad Francisco de Paula Santander, Ocaña, Colombia, attached to the \"Facultad de Ciencias Agrarias y del Ambiente\", to support the administrative process of the same. The balanced scorecard will be taken into account, which is a management tool based on indicators that facilitate the monitoring and achievement of farm objectives, helping the organization to meet its objectives, bearing in mind that the balanced scorecard has 4 important approaches to the process: client, internal processes, innovation and training. For the development of the investigation a methodology with a quantitative approach will be handled where it is tried to know the handling of the processes and to adapt them to the models of government of technologies of the information, with the objective to diagnose and to determine the key indicators of the productive processes of the farm of the university contributing to the continuous improvement. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.Research in the field of innovation in business, management, and accounting (BMA) in Latin America (LATAM) has surpassed all expectations of its net output. Yet this digital tide suggests several concerns regarding its impact and both its established and emergent research topics at the individual, institutional, and country level. In this paper, an outlook of the field was developed based on a sample of + 1300 documents indexed in Scopus from 1983 to 2018. Public institutions in Brazil and Colombia have been both the most cited and productive in the region. Nevertheless, documents lead by non-LATAM authors showed significant differences in both paper citations and journals’ h-index compared to leading authors from LATAM. Three of the major concerns raised were, first, a growing inter-regional gap among LATAM countries. Second, the intensive use of a journal with predatory features over the last 5\\xa0years, therefore cites/document measure is at the lowest point of the past 17\\xa0years. And third, the delay of recently emergent topics in the region that have been in the literature for more than a decade, while frontier topics for BMA innovation such as those of Industry 4.0 remain unnoticed. © 2019, The Author(s).This article presents a proposal of conceptual model for public administrations that allows analyzing the level of IT management capacity as an enabler of smart cities from a multidimensional and dynamic approach taking into account technological, institutional and innovation aspects. The model includes five domains (e-government strategy, Public Innovation, Data Management, IT Services and Infrastructure) that are described in terms of key domain areas, objectives and questions. The model was conceptually validated with four IT offices in Colombia and a pilot test was developed in the Atlantic department. A profile of information technology management capabilities was obtained from public data of the Ministry of ICT in Colombia.

Although the strategic theory has delivered the references to understand the relationships between these two variables, there are still many gaps that need to be filled, and more empirical validation is necessary. This study aimed to verify how the relationship between innovation and performance is affected by the presence of precursor variables such as competitive intensity and organizational slack. The study was carried out through an explanatory and cross-sectional investigation, by applying structural equation modeling (SEM) to a sample of SMEs in Bogotá (Colombia). The results make a relevant contribution to the literature on strategic management by showing that competitive intensity and organizational slack induce innovation and positively impact performance. © RAE.Aim: To determine the effectiveness of a case management model for approaching multi-pathological people in a health promoting entity of the contributory healthcare scheme in Bogotá, Colombia between 2018 -. Design: Mixed methods research. Method: The study contemplates two components: a quantitative component using a quasi-experimental analytical design before and after longitudinal intervention to determine the effectiveness of the case management model and a qualitative descriptive design to understand the experience of the participants about the model. The Administrative Department of Science, Technology and Innovation of Colombia (Colciencias) funded this project by means of call 777—November 2017, under the financing agreement No. 848—December 2017. Discussion: Addressing problems deriving from the structure of the Colombian healthcare system is crucial for implementing case management models. Furthermore, the effectiveness of such models may be affected by power relations and market failures, but the proved potential of a model may represent a generalized benefit for the Colombian health system. Impact: In Colombia, considering complications and management of chronic non-communicable diseases as isolated cases is considered as the highest cost events in healthcare provision, since an average of 12.8\\xa0million pesos is invested in each patient. This has led to rethink the management in these patients by means of a comprehensive model that guarantees the effectiveness of healthcare delivery, in the framework of a healthcare system heavily affected by payment capacity, where the market has a strong predominance, such as the case of Colombia.

The case that the paper explores focuses on experiential learning and learning in adulthood to design a learning model that considers context and socio-demographic characteristics, makes clear the interconnections between sustainability principles, entrepreneurship rationale and design methodologies and includes actions and processes of reflection and contextual interaction. Design/methodology/approach: Following a recursive argument, the paper applies design research methodology (DRM) to systematically design the “transformative innovation model” that Product Co Creation Centers (PC3) from the University of Twente (The Netherlands) has developed. Findings: Building on Kolb’s cycle of experiential learning, the result of applying DRM is a learning cycle of confrontation, observation, practice and application. The proposed learning model is applied to a specific setting in Colombia, allowing to verify and validate whether the learning model leads to the expected outcomes. It is argued that an interdisciplinary approach, a focus on feedback loops and the consideration of the context are important elements for addressing and transforming complex problems related to sustainable development from the bottom-up. Originality/value: This paper contributes to academic research in management emphasizing a solution-finding approach based on a prescription-driven research process, informed by design science research. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.Under today’s competitive conditions, micro, small and medium-sized enterprises in Popayán (Colombia) must maintain their economic development in competitive markets. The objective is to determine the role of innovation in Popayán enterprises, as a competitiveness factor to achieve improvement of the quality of life in the region. The research is qualitative, exploratory and uses as an instrument the semistructure interview in thirty companies. The main results indicate that innovation is based on guidelines or technologies for continuous improvement in processes, products and services that are applied as a competitive advantage; framed in external factors to be aware of changes in the environment and take advantage of technological improvements, and internal factors in implementation of open, participatory management, decentralization in decision-making, motivation of staff and commitment to innovation. As important conclusions, it is obtained that, innovation is a competitive advantage that allows the differentiation, and adapt to changes of the environment. It can be seen that companies offer improved products and services, and to innovate, they do not invest large amounts of resources, however, they have managed to achieve innovation and, therefore, improvement in quality of life. © Universidad del Zulia.

However, both research and empirical evidence about its development is very limited. Innovation based on firms’ capacity of transformation and exploitation is one of the main keys to acquisition and exploitation of open innovation. This empirical study analyses the relationship between absorptive capabilities and acquisition and exploitation open innovation capabilities in a sample of 123 organizations situated in the city of Medellin, Colombia. The findings show that firms developing absorptive capabilities may have better probabilities to improve their open innovation acquisition and exploitation. This study suggests that companies where managers motivate their employees to use external information and external knowledge in the innovation process may have a better chance of improving their innovation performance. © IAMOT 2019.In this changing world and globalized economy, technology transfer processes play a fundamental role in the learning and development of a company’s capabilities, leading the organization’s growth strategies towards a technological flow consisting of the dissemination, transmission and appropriation of knowledge, experiences, know-how and technologies from one organization to another in order to obtain for both a benefit that contributes to being competitive and remaining in the market. From a business perspective, technology and knowledge are fundamental assets for the growth and sustainability of the organization, being these the pillars on which competitiveness and its differentiation in the market are based. Today, technological development and the creation of new and improved products and services have become drivers for the global economy, whereas emerging as challenges for organizations that must keep pace with the advance of science, technology and innovation if they want to remain in the market being competitive and generating returns (Rios and Marroquín, 2012). Technology transfer strategies then become drivers and generators of knowledge that impact the development of technological capabilities in the company and directly or indirectly promote the growth of a sector of the economy. These types of projects bring with them an effort on the part of the organizations that use personnel, resources and time in a transfer process in search of the increase of their technological capacities and business development. In Colombia, for example, technology-based organizations are companies that usually make use of this type of transfer processes such as licensing agreements, technical assistance and services contracts, mobility of personnel towards other industries, company mergers or acquisitions or intellectual property rights, with the objective of impacting their business growth through the development of new and better products and services for the benefit of their clients, in addition to impacting the country’s industrial development. An example of this is the Corporación de Ciencia y Tecnología para el Desarrollo de la Industria Naval, Marítima y Fluvial—COTECMAR (Science and Technology Corporation for the Development of the Naval, Maritime and Fluvial Industry), which by developing technology transfer projects has achieved the country’s technological independence in terms of the manufacture of ships and naval devices, appropriating technologies and knowledge from shipyards with the most experience in the world. Given this situation, this article presents a conceptualization and establishes the main characteristics of technology transfer processes, tracks the main contributions of authors and institutions towards the evaluation of the effects of such projects on the growth of the company and finally proposes a process for the evaluation of their impact through a practical case. The evaluation methodology is based on the disaggregation of dimensions used by the Logical Framework Methodology guided by the four approaches put forward by Daniel Stufflebeam to carry out an evaluation process. © IAMOT 2019.Considering that myths in organizations tell stories that allow recognizing a set of values, beliefs and ideologies that imprint individuality to the organization, the purpose of this study is to propose a conceptual tool for Organizational management by analyzing and interpreting myths in organizations. Said tool can be easily implemented, as it is shown in its practical application to the analysis of innovation in the city of MedellÃ\\xadn, Colombia. In the past, MedellÃ\\xadn was associated with drug trafficking and destruction and today is considered the most innovative city in the world. By applying the proposed tool to the innovation case of MedellÃ\\xadn, it is possible to analyze and understand how this transformation was possible in the city of MedellÃ\\xadn and how the myth of management is an intermediary between the myth of referenceâ€”paradigm of the pastâ€”and the organizational mythâ€”associated with organizational goals.

Program that seeks to improve the living conditions of victims of violence. It begins with the demobilization of paramilitary groups and the return of families to their plots; It is intended that they produce fresh foods, improve their diet and market surpluses. This study investigates the perceptions of the beneficiaries through in-depth interviews and participant observation. The fieldwork was carried out for 2 months, using the non-probabilistic sampling technique, with 40 older adults from the San Miguel district in the municipality of Sonson. Of the interviews conducted, training was received for 40% of the beneficiaries, and training in broiler management allowed them to improve their diet; In addition, the beneficiaries believe that the productive techniques taught demand a long time and there is no reduction in production costs or increase in short-term income. With this study, the perception and adaptation strategies that families use in the face of change or innovation processes are recognized. © 2019 Korean Society of Exercise Rehabilitation.The objective of this article is to analyze energy management from the perspective of clean and sustainable development in institutions that provide health services in Colombia. The study is carried out through a qualitative approach with a method of documentary review of the literature with information from scientific articles of the last 8 years, located in specialized databases, this with the purpose of exploring advances in this area worldwide and determine the contributions that could be replicated in the country. Results show that there is evidence of institutional support for the development of energy management, as well as the definition of various alternatives and areas of intervention depending on the different services provided. It is concluded that the sources of greatest energy consumption are concentrated in air conditioning and lighting, and that strategies to reduce costs are related to the optimization of energy supply contracts and hospital facilities. © 2019 Centro de Informacion Tecnologica.

Then the question arises: How could the administration of HEI be improved? Thus, the objective of this Investigation is to analyze the importance of IMS in modern management, as well as how IMS affect the strategic institutional direction. The results present a methodology to implement the IMS and make it integrate with the Higher Education Quality Assurance System -SACES. The following studies relate to the way of continuing integrating other systems of management, one presents of conclusive form the integration to the SIG of the management of the Investigation, development and innovation I+D+I through the NTC 5801 standard, case Universidad Militar Nueva Granada -UMNG. © 2018 IEEE.This paper aims to analyse the determinants of innovation capacity in medium-sized firms. It analyses the following factors: Culture of participative leadership, work climate and well-being, ideation and organization structures, development of know-how, exploitation of external knowledge, regeneration and individual activity. The approach of this study is descriptive quantitative field and not experimental. The project used a data collection questionnaire with 21 items, to a sample of medium-sized companies in Valledupar, Colombia. The results indicate that the determinants of innovation capacity are present in the companies analysed in the study. Additionally, the ANOVA results show that there are significant differences between the culture factor and participative leadership, with the factor of regeneration. Likewise, there are differences between the exploitation of external knowledge and working climate and well-being, ideation and organizational structures, development of know-how, regeneration and individual activity. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.In developing countries it is necessary to understand how knowledge transfer (KT) occurs via human capital from universities to regions. This transfer can be viewed as diffusion process and is one essential factor in explaining regional innovation and resulting socioeconomic developments. This phenomenon has been studied at the organizational level, however there are few contributions that consider spreading process models over networks in the macro context. This paper presents a KT model of human capital from university nodes to productive organization nodes for seven Colombian regions, and examines how the proportion of graduates absorbed by each region generates new knowledge products. The phenomenon we consider is based on the susceptible-infected-susceptible (SIS) epidemic process, where the spread parameters are related to the knowledge absorption capacity and the ineffectiveness or unused knowledge of the previous spreading process in the region. In addition, the model tries to explain the dependence of knowledge products (KP) with Science, Technology, Engineering and Math (STEM) graduates and the productive structure complexity. To validate the model, we have used the data of13 consecutive years obtained from the Education Ministry, as well as from the Science and Technology Observatory of Colombia. Our findings reflect that the proposed model explains the KT phenomenon, where each node or region is a heterogeneous node, because they have different absorption and ineffectiveness parameters, as well as, diverse productive structure configurations. © 2018 IEEE.The aim of this study is to analyze the effects of different modes of learning on innovation and profitability in SMEs in two Latin American countries; Mexico and Colombia. The data were obtained using a sample of 250 companies in the industrial sector operating in both countries. Results show that an integrated mode of learning based on internal and external knowledge supported by technological infrastructure have positive and significant effects on the degree of innovation and the profitability in SMEs However this effect appears to be not significantly different from the traditional SMEs mode of learning based mainly on market orientation. © 2018Mining is always a controversial issue and mainly when the discussion is addressed to developing countries. In Colombia, the mining panorama was and continues to be ruled by a formal, modern, and large-scale mining mainly focused in coal, the exploitation of nickel, and some companies that exploit gold in different places. Also, a large part of the mining activity is done at minor scales, defined in many cases by informality and the subsistence character. Bearing sustainability in mind, it is worth asking about the balance implies by the exploitation without added value of local and strategic materials that are irreversibly scarcer every time, including metallic and non-metallic minerals. Opportunities around natural and non-renewable resources must focus on enhancing the quality of life, the question addressed here is how to penetrate in the global markets of sophisticated products as well as how to be serious about the so-called \"innovation\", but with accent on sustainability and disruptive technologies. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.Industrial symbiosis refers to a collaborative strategy of exchanging physical resources and sharing services among industrial actors, which enhances the resource efficiency and reduces the environmental impacts of industrial operations within the network. Although it can contribute to sustainable development in emerging economies, few studies have examined the dynamics of industrial symbiosis in such regions. We initiated a capacity-building pilot program for industrial symbiosis in Colombia and formulated 20 industrial symbiosis projects with 36 companies. Based on our experience over the first year, we conducted an exploratory case study of the mechanisms that facilitate the development of industrial symbiosis. Specifically, we analyzed the nature of this facilitation and how its activities influence the key determining factors of industrial symbiosis in technical, economic, organizational, social, and institutional categories. Our facilitation approach focused on identifying opportunities and building capacity for industrial symbiosis innovation by influencing mainly the organizational and social factors. The facilitation approach requires further adjustments and experimentation to expand industrial symbiosis and to ensure the eventual implementation of these projects. This study contributes to the understanding of management perspectives of industrial symbiosis development in the context of an emerging economy. © 2018 by the authors.The purpose of the study is to propose a method to analyze altogether the management in science technology and innovation of the universities, government and private sector. The methodology employed in this study integrates an econometric equation system, according with economic and administrative literature concepts; observing baseline indicators. The findings, particularly for Boyacá-Colombia, show tripartite integration in research among the active research groups for scientific production, the Colciencias projects as investment returns in scientific activities and the offer of university programs to produce patents. These results are of importance for the design of public policies of research and development. © 2018 Centro de Informacion Tecnologica.

Colombia was one of the early adopters in Latin America, having introduced EPR in 2007 to manage several end-of-life products, such as pesticide containers, medicines, lead acid batteries, light bulbs, small batteries, computers, and tires. However, there has been no comprehensive investigation into how EPR has been applied in the context of Colombia. Using the case of end-of-life tires, this study aimed to provide an understanding about two aspects of the EPR system in Colombia: the governance structure and the performance in the end-of-life management. This study found that the Colombian EPR governance model imposes full financial and operational responsibilities on tire producers and importers, while it fails to incentivize other actors in the product chain to carry out their allocated tasks and responsibilities. As for the performance, the EPR system has increased the amount of tires collected over the last five years, but the level is low compared with other developed countries, and more importantly, it does not fully promote the recovery of values from tire waste. The analysis of the current situation in Colombia and lessons from other countries suggest that the effectiveness of the EPR policy would require the establishment of solid, but feasible targets, while allowing flexibility in meeting those targets. It would also benefit from the consideration of economic instruments, as well as establishment of complementary policies to promote innovation and strengthen the regulatory controls over the free riders and management of tire waste. © 2018 Elsevier LtdIn recent years, Corporate Universities have become a critical element in the development of human capital inside companies, institutions and organizations, promoting strategies based on knowledge management as an essential factor to achieve social innovation and sustainable competitive advantages aligned with the strategy. Therefore it is essential for these institutions to reach the highest levels of efficiency and excellence in company processes and structures and to achieve planned corporate goals and objectives. In this work an extensive and thorough review of the current literature was carried out in relation to the concept, in order to analyse the latest trends in Corporate Universities. A comparative evaluation with traditional university aspects was performed, identifying their own differentiators, for example the impact on social innovation, the development of sustainable com- petitive advantages, the influence on the company\\'s internal environment, the importance of cultural and technological factors, and the relationship with the orga- nizations strategy, which are important factors in its successful development and interconnection within the company processes. The information obtained from the aforementioned literature review, in combination with the experience gained by the team of consultants and researchers at the PRIME Business School, Sergio Arboleda University, Bogota, Colombia, allowed to present proposed in general terms a new implementation model of Corporate University. This new model is based on five distinct phases, and with minor adaptations could be to any sector in an organization. The study shows that through this Corporate University model, an organization could gain differentiators to increase social innovation, in time gain sustainable competitive advantages, and a desirable alignment with the objectives and strategic goals of the organization. © Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature 2018.

Two techniques are accepted, one of them is the Exploratory Factor Analysis (AFE), and the other, the Confirmatory Factor Analysis (AFC). The sample consisted of 200 observations obtained from the network of high complexity hospitals in Colombia during 2016 and 2017. The research shows a valid instrument from its constructs and determinants (Knowledge Management, Human Resource Managament, Organizational Capabilities, Culture, and finally those associated with the Health Care Organizations). Furthermore, the results of the Confirmatory Factorial Analysis allowed to test the theoretical model. This type of initiative is pioneer for three reasons: 1) The application of the methods to the health sector; 2) the conceptual amplitude of a large number of internal predictors of the Innovation Capabilities and 3) the existence of some descriptive studies is detected, with special attention to innovation in a general way, but the intention of the present work goes far beyond the merely prescriptive works, tries to demonstrate by means of quantitative techniques the singularities of innovation capabilities in the health sector. © 2018 Academia Nacional de Medicina. All Rights Reserved.In recent years, there has been a change in the topic of protection of the elderly in the world, due to the demographic transition process involving growth in the aging of the population and the foreseeable consequences. This is the reason why there has been a need for a common frame of reference for the welfare, protection and promotion of the rights of the elderly, including the contribution they can make to society, as well as the products and services that they perceive according to the requirements they demand. This article shares some results of the study*, carried out between 2012 and 2015 in two contexts, Colombia and Spain, whose objective was to understand the social reality of a growing market segment and the importance of current government and social policies for the protection and quality of life in senior citizen population. Health deteriorates generally as it advances in age, requiring special attention in the medium and long term, transposed into greater demand for services for the older person. Social economy companies are called to take action on the matter, considering, in truth, of components of the social quadrihelix, composed of: a) academia, through the approach of new professional skills, the exchange of experiences and the promotion of good practices, in addition to research and innovation for the elderly, b) the company, generating or providing appropriate services and products for this population, c) local, regional and national government through the enactment and implementation of the national policy of aging, seeking the protection and defense of the rights of the elderly, and d) the community, through volunteering and the inclusion of the person in conditions of social vulnerability. Thus, the four fronts, imply the commitment that both the citizen and the institutions have to society, in a common work under the same purpose, make visible the degree of corporate and institutional social responsibility and the implementation in benefit of appropriately intervening the situation of old age of population, coordinating and promoting national and international cooperation initiatives that create links with different stakeholders, in order to meet the needs, desires, expectations and tastes, through the quality and relevance of the service perceived by the older person, both in the residences where they live, the products they buy and consume, inside and outside the environment where they reside. The advances of science in recent years has been vertiginous, in a more significant way in medicine and in the new technologies applied to medical science in the pharmacological field, favouring longevity with quality life for the elderly, providing them with the opportunity for more autonomy, physical and mental activity. At the same time, it means that companies and institutions must offer new and better services in accordance with the expectations and needs, not only of the elderly, but also of the family members and administrative staff of the home/residence who need to improve the well-being of the person in charge of, allowing the user to make their own decisions of where to live, what products to consume, which brands and characteristics according to benefits they perceive and require. This is how, from the theoretical review on key conceptions of the elderly**, the demographic trends, the institutional framework of welfare policies in protection and social responsibility that affect the population of the elderly and that could influence health, housing, security and pensions, the variables to be taken into account were defined and three structured surveys and a questionnaire were designed to obtain primary information, highlighting the residences as a starting point and the public involved: seniors, relatives, directors of residential centers and subject matter experts. Allowing to contextualize \"in a general way\" the social welfare, the socioeconomic situation of the elderly population and the social policies that shelter it, as well as the business environment considered a challenge in the population aging process, which goes from managing human talent as a strategic asset in a competitive society until defining and implementing inclusive public policies. Reaching some theories and approaches of entrepreneurship social responsibility and the relationship between business / senior citizens, starting from the liberal relation to the approach of social institutions and thus get to relate some considerations of the residential environment (Colombia-Spain) and quality components of life as a foundation of the social welfare of the elderly as a being of multiple and interdependent needs. Finally, the study shows how, in Spain, in contrast to Colombia, interventions for the benefit of the elderly are notable, from the relationship with workers, volunteers and families. Meanwhile, corporate relations in social management, cooperation and solidarity, are found to be more visible in Spain as a comprehensive strategy and social content, however in both contexts there are gaps in innovation, in processes and products for the activity and physical mobility of this population. In same way, they are also working on the relationship: social responsibility / innovation. In Colombia, some progress has been made, but there is still a lack of promotion, articulation and initiatives of internal and external social responsibility, since there are no clear guidelines in a social responsibility management system that supports initiatives and proposals to manage participation or links with other entities of different sectors. However, in both contexts, it is necessary to coordinate and promote national and international cooperation, which allow the link with different stakeholders, in order to achieve the satisfaction of needs and desires, as well as the quality and relevance of perceived service by the older adult, in the residences and in the external environment where they reside. © 2018 CIRIEC-España.Colombia is a country that has achieved significant tourism growth in recent years. However, there is limited empirical evidence about its tourism development. Organizational innovation in tourism enterprises is one of the keys to Colombia maintaining positive tourism development. This empirical study analyzes organizational innovation in 364 of Colombiás tourism companies. The findings show that “Directing and Management (The way of directing and managing company)” and “Commercialization and Sales (The way to directing and managing the commercialization and sales of a company)” have a significant relationship with Colombiás tourist enterprises organizational innovations. © 2016, © The Author(s) 2016.After being known as the ‘murder capital of the world’ in the 1990s, Medellin has pioneered innovative forms of city planning and management and was acclaimed the most innovative city in the world by the Urban Land Institute (ULI) in 2013. Hosting the World Urban Forum in 2014 allowed it to showcase its approach, key elements of which have been: creation of innovative transport infrastructure linking poorer peripheral districts to the city centre; culture-led regeneration; strong support of local development from the local business sector; and a successful municipally-owned utilities company. However, the city is spreading outwards without services and employment being provided; new low-income developments are replicating high-rise models which failed worldwide; there is limited intervention in the existing informal areas, many being in highly vulnerable locations where the level of risk is likely to increase with climate change; development has little regard for topography, ecological and environmental considerations; investment in accessible and good quality public space is restricted to some areas; the quality of the public realm does not always support health and wellbeing of the ageing population. This paper explores the institutional and socio-economic context in which Medellín has achieved the internationally recognized status of an ‘innovative city’. It questions to what extent social equity, environmental sustainability and citizen empowerment have been promoted as per the ULI claims when it conferred the prize. The paper queries the extent to which ‘urban innovation’ is happening in Medellín, which has considerable implications given its recently found role as a ‘model’ city in Latin America and beyond. © 2017 Elsevier LtdThis paper presents the design of a key-factors model of logistic capabilities in small and middle-sized companies of manufacturing sector in Cartagena, Colombia, as a tool for decision making on a large scale. Published papers were reviewed to identify variables related to assessment and evaluation of logistic capabilities, which were systematized on the following dimensions: Flexibility, Innovation, Added value, Data and Logistic process. Afterwards, reliability and validity of the construct of associated factors was evaluated by using Cronbach\\'s alpha coefficient and exploratory factor analysis using principal components and Varimax rotation. Results show a KMO (Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin) sample adequacy of 0.728 which sustains the following logistic factors: technology, process design, innovation, demand estimation, strategy, information management, commercial and organizational management, customer service, planning and, product design. It was established that technology and internal processes have a huge impact on logistic capabilities of companies. © 2018 Interciencia Association.

It is a qualitative study, focused on the comparison of curricular profiles, approaches and contents of the programs, which were recorded in tables, as an instrument for gathering and analyzing information. The main results point to the presence of diverse approaches of how knowledge management is understood, from linking it with educational, technological, and innovation processes to properly business and productive processes, relating in turn to the thematic-curricular orientation of the Faculties and Universities that manage them. Regarding the profiles of graduates, the competences oscillate between the management of projects, coordination of technological processes to support the creation, organization and transfer of knowledge, mediation and negotiation. In conclusion, there is a high potential for cooperation and academic collaboration among postgraduate programs, as a substantive element that generates synergies for the development of research projects and collective publishing initiatives. © 2018, Universidad del Zulia.

A descriptive study was developed and the companies were selected by non-probabilistic sampling at convenience. The results indicate that knowledge management practices allowed companies to: Reformulate their strategy, initiate diversification processes and be leaders in innovation. The main conclusion is that the efforts of these companies to adopt knowledge management practices have turned them into innovative organizations (processes, products and services), with great impact on the development of the country. © 2018, Universidad del Zulia.

Seventy percent of the major burn patients have face burns and their surgical management depends on the depth of the burn; usually full thickness burns have to undergo early tangential excision with immediate coverage once the patient is stable and in the partial thickness facial burns the surgical management is dermoabrasion and coverage with topical agents, synthetic dressings or biological dressings. However, the dressing changes with topical agents are painful and frequent procedures and many of the synthetic and biological dressings are expensive and not available for some health systems. The aim of this study was to evaluate the use of amniotic membrane glicerol preserved 85%, as a transient biological dressing in the management of partial and total thickness facial burns. Methods. We developed an observational descriptive prospective study case series of 52 consecutive patients. We used exposed 85% glycerol preserved amniotic membrane as a transient biological coverage provided by the Science, Biotechnology and Innovation District Institute of Health (IDCBIS) of the Health Secretary of Bogotá (Colombia), without secondary dressings, immediately after mechanic dermoabrasion in patients with partial and total thickness facial burns. Results. All the patients epithelialized between the 5th and 10th day with only one application of the amniotic membrane without secondary dressings or topical agents; also the patients did not show wound healing alterations. Some patients stayed in the hospital longer than 10 days because they presented major burns. None of them presented infection and all referred absence of pain during the postoperative period. Conclusions. The use of amniotic membrane as a transient biological dressing for the treatment of partial and total thickness facial burns is an economic, effective and available tool in countries with skin banks. The use of the amniotic membrane after the dermoabrasion avoids daily wound dressing changes, decreases and controls the pain and promotes wound healing and epithelization. © 2018 Sociedad Espanola de Cirugia Plastica Reparadora y Estetica (SECPRE).

In this sense following the guidelines of the SDGs and the 2030 world agenda, this studie fixes its gaze in Usiacurí, recognized municipality as the Manger of the Colombian Caribbean, whose potential as a tourist destination were characterized in the Strategic Plan of development ecotourism, tourism and Cultural (PEDETC) of the municipality Usiacurí 2007-2017, in this sense the objective focused on formulating a proposal deemed social innovation, the chain partner productive and inclusive tourism and its sustainable value to tourist destinations located in the municipality Usiacurí. The research is descriptive and analytical, data will be collected through primary sources (application of surveys representatives of the governmental sector, members of the Foundation for the progress of Usiacurí (COPROUS), cooperative Weaver\\'s) Usiacurí (COOPUS), the community in general and secondary sources literature review and internet sources. Results correspond to the first objective to determine the scope of the strategies designed in the PEDETC for its positioning as a tourist destination, denoting divergent views among the respondents, since the 73.78% consider that the PEDETC is has developed, while the 26.21% thinks that many of their strategies have paralyzed or not have been initiated. This leads to think that in general the PEDECT paid off, even though the results of the rest of goals will give one much greater insight allowing orienting a proposal that makes a tourist destination of Usiacurí.

The main goal of this project was to contribute in social and economic reinsertion of young offenders within society by developing labour and social skills, and, therefore, helping them to improve their livelihood and life quality. The strategy consisted in a participatory design and implementation of the project named \"Popular Design, Productive Chains and Peace Building\" in the municipalities of Cartagena and Turbaco (Bolivar, Colombia). The project envisioned not only teaching to these minors inmates how to build handcrafts, but also included the construction of sustainable productive chains providing great value to their artisanal work. These NEOCraftstrategy (handicrafts renovation movement) included the handmade products transcendence, its environmental responsibility, the use of natural materials and waste management. Therefore, the fundamental value of the craftsmanship lies on its cultural and ancestral tradition that gives uniqueness to the product, separating it from the mass and global consumption of branded products. For ASOMENORES, and for this specific project, the social rehabilitation and reinsertion into society depends on various factors: one of them is the psychological rehabilitation provided by the penitentiary; another factor, the intervention was originated by this project through the construction of productive chains. The strategy was focused on determining skills’ assessment of each participant. From that starting point, the result was the development of individual, technical and competitive advantages. These advantages emphasised over their culture, traditions and perspectives, where was planned to create and innovate with systemic awareness, inclusive and participative added value. It is expecting once the participants are resealed, they will be prepare, with proper tools, to be part of different companies as employees or create their own business. In this way, there is a high probability of decreasing their chances for these young guys to commit an offence again. The innovation of this project lies on the fact that different aspects such as the legal and social components are being intervened from the Design’s Perspective, aimed to achieve institutional changes where all the stakeholders will be benefited from the project, starting with young inmates and their families, and those involved in the training process such as psychologists, teachers and penitentiary guardians, and foremost, the Industrial Design students who managed and experience the development of an educational process from a sustainable productive standpoint. © 2018 Institution of Engineering Designers The Design Society.

Bogota, the biggest city of Colombia, concentrates most of the financial and human resources of the country. However, the indexes and measures of regional innovation does not reflect this capability of the city, and most the structures supporting the innovational plans of Bogota are ill implemented or not implemented at all. Even if transform a resources-based economy to a knowledge-based is slow, an appropriate structure and clear roles of the public and private organizations could boost this change. Therefore, this research shows an analysis of the structure of the regional innovation system (RIS), specially focused on information flows, cooperation mechanisms, and collaborative work. Using rigorous organizational cybernetics methods and social network analysis, an initial diagnosis shows that the RIS of Bogota does not connect properly each one of the activities of the system within organizations. Likewise, a lack of communication and control mechanisms result in fragmentation between subsystems and their activities. Based on these results, a proposal for a synergetic network is presented, where resources and activities are tied up. This proposal of public policy shows the advantages of the changes on the relationships between actors, and possible improvement on the communication and control mechanisms. © 2018 Institute of Industrial Engineers (IIE).

El primer resultado se presenta en este artículo. El objeto del mismo es presentar la reflexión teórica que nos permitirá tener una guía de análisis para definir la economía solidaria en Colombia. A través de una metodología cualitativa basada en el método de análisis documental y utilizando diferentes técnicas de recolección de información, analizamos dos corrientes demográficas que han tenido incidencia en la definición de la economía solidaria en Colombia. La primera es la corriente latinoamericana y la segunda es la corriente de economía social y solidaria. Finalmente hacemos una revisión del marco normativo para proponer algunos elementos teóricos que son la base de la investigación. Este artículo es la realización del primer objetivo específico del proyecto en mención. © 2018 CIRIEC-España.In Colombia, the theoretical and doctrinal origin for the definition and conceptualization of what is understood by solidary economy is not very clear, for this reason we consider the realization of a research project that will lead us to this. The first result is presented in this article. The objective is to present the theoretical reflection that will allow us to have an analysis guide to define the solidarity economy in Colombia. Through a qualitative methodology based on the method of documentary analysis and using different information collection techniques, we analyze two demographic trends that have had an impact on the definition of solidarity economy in Colombia. The first is the Latin American current and the second is the current social and solidarity economy. Finally, we review the regulatory framework to propose some theoretical elements that are the basis of the investigation. This article is the realization of the first specific objective of the project in mention. As results, we find that in Latin America we can mention two currents. The first refers to the ethical- moral current that has as main authors Luis Razeto and Pablo Guerra. The second is the economic current of the solidarity economy with important authors such as José Luis Coraggio, Max Neef and Singer. In Europe, we find a vision called social economy, its main exponents are Jose Luis Monzón and Rafael Chávez in Spain and Jean Luis Laville in France. These definitions allowed us to discuss the denomination used in Colombia and confirm that the term solidarity economy represents in Colombia an important sector that encompasses countless organizations in different parts of the national territory. These organizations are based on collective and community work seeking the solution to specific problems. Solidarity economy is another way of looking at the relationship between economy, human and his context, where he bases his actions on loyalty practices with culture, humanity, territory, in search of a balance between being, having and living. In Colombia, through Law 454 of 1998 two types of organizations are distinguished, those of solidarity economy and solidarity developed, there are organizations of a solidary nature such as cooperatives, employee funds, mutual associations but also We recognize associations, corporations, foundations, volunteer groups, community action boards, among many others that respond to the conceptual and empirical characteristics of the solidarity economy mentioned below. The main conclusions refer to the characteristics of the solidarity economy in Colombia. From the social point of view, the solidarity economy is the means to achieve the social development sought by the territories. From the economic point of view, it is a new rationality of movement, use, accumulation and relationship between the economic factor and being. From the political point of view, self-management seeks the independence of the State in relation to its decisions. However, it is a movement that projects changes within public policy focused on equity between the social, economic, cultural and environmental. From the territorial aspect, it seeks to protect the development of the territory, coexisting with its geographic and cultural context, exploring new rationalities of territory from its socio-economic and cultural practices. From the cultural point of view, it seeks to recognize its origin in solidarity, cooperative and mutualist practices, striving to rescue them again, invigorate them and encourage them from and for the territories with new forms of organization. From the environmental aspect, it seeks the generation of territorial development balanced with the environment and its social context. From the organizational point of view, it is based on the participative, valued activity towards the human being and his capacities, the self-management, the associativity, the solidarity and cooperation are transversal in the organizational structures. From the individual, considers that the person is the end and not a means, take it to their freedoms is one of the purposes so that once free contribute to the overall development of society. Finally, it seeks the participation of the human being as the end of social, political, economic and cultural relations and realities, as a leading actor that seeks continuous but dynamic and changing development, guaranteeing solidarity, cooperative and respectful coexistence with others and their environment. Unlike Latin American countries such as Brazil, Argentina and Uruguay, in Colombia the solidarity economy hardly emerges as an incipient social movement, because it does not have enough identity to give it meaning given the existing heterogeneity and diversity of practices that could be categorized as solidarity economies. The social actors that are participating in the construction of the solidarity economy are varied and diverse; unions, universities, entities of the solidarity economy system, the State, the private sector, the church, international cooperation, organized civil society, popular rural and urban movements, which are called to the strength of the social movement seeking public policies that recognizes the importance of the solidary sector in Colombia. Some Colombian universities have developed since the mid-twentieth century, research programs made up of research groups that have different lines of work related to solidarity economy, as well as formal undergraduate and postgraduate and non-formal teaching programs such as continuing education programs. extension programs that mean work with the community and dissemination actions represented by journals, books, texts and academic events to present research results as well as national university networks (the Unicossol Network Corporation and Ciriec Colombia) related to international networks since decades ago, which have advanced significantly in the construction not only of the concept, but of a culture, movement and social force of the solidarity economy. These networks and research processes allow the solidarity economy to be recognized as a growing sector in the country, with important challenges in terms of the territorial reorganization that Colombia is currently experiencing, as a result of the negotiation processes with the armed groups. The solidarity organizations have emerged and continue to appear as a result of the absence of the State and the urgency of solutions to social problems that have arisen because of the war in Colombia. This particularity in Colombia makes the study of the solidarity economy urgent and necessary in a country where research has been difficult to develop, public investment in rural development processes, access to different territories, among others. Finally, the contribution of this article is based on the effort made by the Unicossol Network in recognizing the solidarity economy as the main source of development in Colombia. The union of researchers from different universities at national level, with different points of view and with experiences in the territory has facilitated the discussion and the approach to the definition of a term little studied in Colombia. © 2018 CIRIEC-España.This study presents a comparative analysis of the management of innovation among family and non-family companies of the Graphic Communication Industry in Colombia. For which a questionnaire was applied in order to know the divergences in the innovation process carried out by these two types of organizations. From this, the methodology of Generalized Linear Models (MLG) was used and the Bayesian inference was used on the parameters of the model, analyzing the effect of the family business, the products that commercialize on the management of innovation in goods observed as a product tangible Obtaining in this way, the identification of some characteristics of innovation management and divergences with non-family companies, among them: a tendency towards the type of preferred innovation, the different sources and objectives to innovate, and the factors that hinder its process of innovation. © Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature 2018.The purpose of this study is to analyze whether the impacts of innovation on business performance between family and non-family businesses differ within the Colombian Graphic Sector. The study academically allows to deepen the way in which the familiar companies carry out the processes and the generation of capacities for the innovation, This is complemented very well with the proposal of quantitative models applied to the innovation management carried out by these companies, which makes an important contribution in the knowledge of these, since family businesses are considered by most countries as the main driver of their economies [1–5]. On the other hand, it is considered that family businesses, which constitute between 80 and 90% of companies worldwide, are an important driver of GDP and employment growth [6]. This research is a retrospective study on the organizational performance of the Graphic Sector companies in Colombia. Information was obtained from 107 companies regarding the variables: sales, operating expenses, sales expenses, non-operational expenses, sales costs and service provision, total equity and net profit before taxes, between 2006 and 2012. Subsequently, in 2016 a representative sample of 104 companies was taken and a questionnaire was carried out to obtain specific information about them, such as example, if they are familiar, the product type and information related to the innovation management they develop. To measure organizational performance, the ROA and ROE financial indices are calculated annually. © Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature 2018.Micro and small enterprises in Colombia (MSEs) need to strengthen their competitive, sustainable and sustainable advantages to respond adapt and sustain in the market. They should focus their efforts on knowledge management, Information and Communication Technologies (ICT), innovation, continuous improvement, and Co-Creation. This paper presents a co-creation model based on knowledge management that allows us to innovate in the dairy sector, as a form of adaptation and survival, differentiation and competitiveness as a tool for decision-making. © Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature 2018.An econometric study is carried out using a panel data model with fixed effects to identify the industrial development determinants in Colombia during the term 2005–2015. The database used in the study corresponds to World Bank and the Colombian state. The determinants of industrial growth identified at the theoretical level that allow the enhancement of productive capacities to face foreign competition in Colombia are: innovation; networks of innovations and knowledge among companies and organizations; the interest rate; the capital-product ratio, the unit labor cost; and the exchange rate. The amount invested in scientific, technological and innovation activities by industrial group is the only variable that is not significant in the model. © Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature 2018.Introduction: Studying the academic and scientific contributions from the San Juan de Dios Hospital Complex (CHSJD by its acronym in Spanish) —which include the San Juan de Dios Hospital, Instituto Materno Infantil and Instituto de Inmunología— during the twentieth century is an important conceptual basis for promoting the development of university hospitals in the country and the continent. Objective: To expose the contributions from the CHSJD to different fields of medicine, the development of medical education and the construction of the school of Medicine. Materials and methods: A qualitative descriptive analysis was carried out, focusing on the main milestones reached by the CHSJD in the period between 1866 and the suspension of its activities. Key informants were interviewed, and an online survey and a documentary review were performed. Results: Thanks to its association with the faculties of the Universidad Nacional de Colombia, the San Juan de Dios Hospital was a pioneering university hospital in Colombia. Its multiple contributions in different disciplines are still in force and, despite its closing, it is still recognized as one of the largest sources of scientific knowledge in the country. Conclusion: It is essential for the development of university hospitals that the scientific-teaching staff takes on the challenge of implementing and developing innovations aimed at solving health challenges. © 2018, Universidad Nacional de Colombia.

In Colombia, the economic system has been hit by a multidiversity of factors, including the internal armed conflict, which is approaching a concerted goal, thanks to the current government\\'s management. All this combined with the demands of globalization, which has dominated the region\\'s scenarios, have greatly boosted the positioning of entrepreneurship as an alternative to productivity, marketing and innovation. Then, and in order to establish the factors that are promoting and stimulating entrepreneurship in Cartagena, a documentary review of the context of the project will be carried out and different studies and research that may contribute to the design of future programs or intervention plans, in pursuit of the promotion of the quality of life of the communities of this important Colombian city. © 2018.This research determines human management factors that contribute to the generation of innovation in SMEs of the food industry in Barranquilla, to enact their relationship; the theoretical basis allowed to establish the conceptual dimension from the administrative management and the policy of STI as reference.

Using a policy-design framework, we identify a causal mechanism linking the opening of a policy window to policy change as a combination of the emergence of a new policy network, the adoption of a new policy paradigm and the selection of a new instruments mix. Drawing on Bayesian statistics, the 11 tests conducted on the causal mechanism show the importance of State resources of information, authority, treasury and organization to assess the outcome of policy change. © 2018, Universidad de los Andes, Bogota Colombia.

In several instances, agricultural production systems may be considered largely unsustainable in socioeconomic and ecological (resource conservation and use and impact on nature) terms. Novel technological and management options that can serve as vehicles to promote the provision of multiple benefits, including the improvement of smallholder livelihoods, are needed. We call for a paradigm shift to allow designing and implementing agricultural systems that are not only efficient (serving as a means to promote development based on the concept of creating more goods and services while using fewer resources and creating less waste) but can also be considered synergistic (symbiotic relationship between socio-ecological systems) by simultaneously contributing to major objectives of economic, ecological, and social (equity) improvement of agro-ecosystems. These transformations require strategic approaches that are supported by participatory system-level research, experimentation, and innovation. Using data from several studies, we here provide evidence for technological and management options that could be optimized, promoted, and adopted to enable agricultural systems to be efficient, effective, and, indeed, sustainable. Specifically, we present results from a study conducted in Colombia, which demonstrated that, in rice systems, improved water management practices such as AlternateWetting and Drying (AWD) reduce methane emissions (~70%). We also show how women can play a key role in AWD adoption. For livestock systems, we present in vitro evidence showing that the use of alternative feed options such as cassava leaves contributes to livestock feed supplementation and could represent a cost-effective approach for reducing enteric methane emissions (22% to 55%). We argue that to design and benefit from sustainable agricultural systems, there is a need for better targeting of interventions that are co-designed, co-evaluated, and co-promoted, with farmers as allies of transformational change (as done in the climate-smart villages), not as recipients of external knowledge. Moreover, for inclusive sustainability that harnesses existing knowledge and influences decision-making processes across scales, there is a need for constant, efficient, effective, and real trans-disciplinary communication and collaboration. © 2017 by the authors.The objective of the present study is to evaluate the professional profile in Information Systems, Library Science and Archival Science declared in the curricular design of the corresponding program at the University of La Salle in Bogotá, Colombia. The study is based on theoretical criteria according to which evaluation of professional profiles is a strategic component in the identification of curricular relevance, on the basis of which adjustments and changes must be proposed aimed at aligning the training offers to the needs imposed by trends in the fields of knowledge and the demands of the labor markets where graduates have accumulated valuable information serving as feedback for those profiles. The qualitative approach and the focal group technique were the essential elements in the methodology. Ten graduates from the Program participated, all of whom held managerial and coordination posts when the study was performed. According to the main results obtained, the following aspects are all highly relevant to the training: project management, budget management, innovation, quality management, knowledge management, planning of projects related to technologies applied to document management, digital management of contents, and preventive conservation of the document heritage in physical and digital formats. It is concluded that professional profile evaluation should be a permanent task which takes account of the constant changes that occur, so as to synchronize the curricular offers of training institutions to the demands of socio-productive sectors and the advancement of science and technology. © 2017, Centro Nacional de Informacion de Ciencias Medicas.

Despite the importance, theoretically given to the TICs, a great gap is found in the scientific literature regarding the measurements of these capabilities in the higher education sector. In this paper, the results of the implementation of a fuzzy inference diagnostic system for organizational capabilities for innovation in a university institution (UI) in the city of Medellin, Colombia are presented. The system consists of the application of a structured diagnostic instrument - type interviewed-to the management and teaching staff of the institution. The data is adapted to the requirements of a fuzzy inference system, in which previously defined variables are related, their values are standardized and entered in an inference system. The values were implemented and processed in the Fuzzy Logic Toolbox - MATLAB. As inference system output, concrete numerical values, and surfaces of fuzzy inference were obtained to formulate organizational strategies aimed at improving the technological innovation capabilities of the institution. © 2017At the end of the first decade of the 21st century, the issues surrounding the quality of water resources are increasingly evident at the global and regional levels. However, under the influence of the environmental reform of the 1990s in Colombia, the institutional framework sought to avoid the threat by leaning towards the decentralized management of sustainability and the application of economic instruments such as the compensatory rate (Pigouvian tax). The purpose of this article is to review the performance of these two standards against the role of civil society in the intervention on water quality in the high basin of the Cauca river. For this, the institutional analysis combined with econometric tools including models with panel, ANOVA and finally main components are used. In the end, the scope of civic citizenship as a complement or alternative to the typical tools of the regionalized public administration is discussed. The results show, among many others, the harmlessness of financial instruments such as compensatory rates to attack water contamination, along with the capacity of social organizations to control associative processes in defense of the river water quality. © 2017 Universidad de Caldas.In the Latin-American context, there is a challenge related to hotel sector, which needs to be competitive and sustainable. The Resource Efficient and Cleaner Production (RECP) as a strategy that involves productive efficiency, environmental protection, and human development, allows creating value and improving the competitive performance. From a perspective of competitive strategy and creating shared value, this study characterizes the relevance of cleaner production and describes its potential contribution to the competitiveness of the hotel sector in Atlántico, Colombia. We developed a descriptive research with a quantitative approach and a descriptive analysis in 36 hotels, through a survey with closed questions with nominal and Likert scale. The RECP allowed obtaining an economic, environmental and social effectiveness in a medium level, to maximize the profits and to fulfill the statutes. We concluded RECP gives the opportunity to rethink the competitive strategies to the creation of shared value through linking environmental and social variables with the organizational management as a source of innovation, productivity, and competitive advantage.The industry and manufacturing processes are characterized by a variety of algorithmic methodologies and techniques that describe their function. Therefore; the methodology for teaching automatic processes control for innovating projects, build a profile of the student based on validated evidence of the professional comprehensive training solution, defined in learning skills (Tobón, in Formación basada en competencias, Pensamiento complejo, diseño curricular y didáctica.

This seems common in third world countries. Intelligent Knowledge based systems (IKBS) have to do with the creation of value from intangible intelligent assets, that are resurrected from amalgams of Artificial Intelligence, Knowledge Engineering (KE), BUSINESS PROCESS REENGINEERING (BPR), Cognitive Systems Engineering, Software Engineering, and Third Millennium organizations, among others. Intelligent behavior requires being able to acquire and manage information, data and knowledge to make effective decisions for organizations to function intelligently in crises. Requires intellectually demanding environments with more open minds. The U. San Jose-FESSANJOSE has developed a supportive environment for decision-making in the complexity of higher education (HE), and a set of planning tools has been designed to deal with the crisis. These tools, are expected to help stakeholders develop and communicate understanding of high priority issues so that smart decisions can be made and implemented during crises in the case of Colombia. After 60 years of war confrontation (civil society, guerrilla, paramilitary) we are preparing toward a post-conflict situation; for labor re-qualification of thousands of victims a new education model based on integrating architectures and knowledge systems is proposed. The post-agreement implies greater social investment especially in education, towards the reconstruction of Peace and Equity that goes beyond social mobility (e.g. employment) with new educational models based on high quality and decentralization. Nowadays the Government of Colombia (GoC) signed an Agreement with the guerilla FARC after 6 years of talks. In the following days the Peace Nobel Prize was granted to the GoC President, Juan M. Santos. The following days new dialogues, with the minor and remaining guerilla ELN, was announced for starting soon in Ecuador. If succeed, the total peace will be warranted. The new educational model, involves: • Individual monitoring and evaluation, • guided by ICT (information and communicationstechnologies), • competencies (supported by KE) • asynchronous methodolyg, • personal tutoring: teaching/automated online (includingmobile devices usage), • for the population of young and adult, victims of armedconflicts, • for people preparation for the IV Industrial Revolution,and to face the transition to the Digital Transformation(to radically improve performance of institutions) Regarding the social situation, in our side we are preparing for a post-conflict situation; we have to prepare thousands of demobilized people and victims, requiring labor re-qualification. In addition, given the deficit of 100,000 ICT Engineers, and 300,000 Technologist (T) and Professional Technicians (PT), e.g. programmers; our proposal is intended as a disruptive innovation to address the post-war digital divide, and this country has based human talent mental rehabilitation, with training and labor requalification. We integrated our own experiences and proposed a new education model, based on the integration into an Intelligent Management Information System (iMIS), of 5 architectures that we previously have implemented in several higher education Institutions (HEI) in Colombia. Those architectures, supported by the convergence of Information, Software, and KE, with Artificial & Computational Intelligence, and guided by mathematical and computational models. iMIS integrates hybrid multilevel architectures with multilevel systems, in order to respond to the solution of HE-ME (middle education) problems, leading to face competitiveness and productivity, observing specifically how to include these technologies for evolving the university into modernity, bringing together the institution governability, the student and teacher productivity, and the High Quality Education (HQE). The paper characterizes an intelligent educational organization of the III millennium, defines post-conflict crises, and discusses a competency-based educational model as part of the alternatives to confront the national crisis with an educational crisis management framework. We are trying to consolidate numerous experiential learnings related to the complexity of HE such as student dropout, educational quality, productivity and competitiveness in an underdeveloped country like Colombia. Finally, the model includes the use of architectural tools already implemented. © 2017 Latin American and Caribbean Consortium of Engineering Institutions.

Conclusions. One of the main contributions of the study is the benefit for current players in the fish innovation system and new ones, such as technology development centers and new ventures, since they will have a route map of innovations on which to focus their investments and project initiatives.This article shows the results obtained from the research entitled \"Impact of public policies on science, technology and innovation in competitiveness, as part of a strategy for the management of innovation in companies ICT sector (information technology and telecommunications), Of the Municipality of Medellín \"as a case study. In this sense, information relevant to the efforts made in this area in recent years is shown and how these have been implemented and incorporated into the innovation capacities of companies, in order to guide the decision-making of government entities, for the feedback of public policies in a context of prioritization of limited resources and the identification of effective instruments to evaluate the impact of public policies and their design. © 2017.Purpose: This paper aims to explore the relationship between clustering and hotel competitiveness in emerging economy destinations by analyzing potential mediation of the management innovations implemented. Design/methodology/approach: This empirical study is based on hotel-level information from a survey including 131 hotels in 2014. Colombia was chosen as a representative of Colombia, Indonesia, Vietnam, Egypt, Turkey and South Africa (CIVETS) emerging destinations. The relationships were analyzed by structural modeling and partial least squares. Findings: Clustering has a positive direct impact on hotel competitiveness and innovation, and there is a positive effect of innovation on competitiveness. Therefore, the link between clustering and competitiveness is partially mediated through implementation of management innovations. Practical implications: Hotels should actively participate in agglomerated destinations and build relationships with established firms by clustering. Interaction with related firms and implementation of management innovations will lead to increased levels of economic competitiveness. Public policymakers should foster collaborative strategic networking in the hospitality industry of emerging economy destinations. Originality/value: This paper focused on separating the direct and indirect effects of clustering on hotel competitiveness. Implementation of management innovations was considered as an outcome derived from clustering in emerging tourist destinations, using the example of Colombia. Clustering stimulates and eases management innovations within the location, and that combination reinforces the role that cooperating while competing plays in hotel competitiveness for destinations with lagging innovation. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to analyse the direct effects of strategic orientation in innovation and competition on personalisation and codification type knowledge management (KM) strategies and their organisational creativity. Design/methodology/approach: The authors counter-checked the hypothesis model with a sample of 169 companies in emerging markets that adopt technology: a country such as Colombia. To do so, the authors used structural equations with the least squares model. Findings: The data indicate that both KM strategies positively influence creativity; however, personalisation has a greater effect. Additionally, SG for innovation has a positive effect on both KM strategies; however, for competition, KM only has an influence on codification. Originality/value: The relation between KM strategies and creativity has been approached on a strictly theoretical level; therefore, this paper provides empirical evidence on the subject. It also establishes the direct effect that SG has on KM strategies, which have so far only been tangentially analysed. In so doing, it goes further than the limitations in the literature regarding analysis of the KM-creativity relationship, but it does not consider business strategy implications. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.The main objective of this research is to establish the level of innovation in technology and strategic direction of small and medium size enterprises (SMEs) in the city of Barranquilla, Colombia. For this purpose, a descriptive research was carried out, using a data collection technique, which analyzed six variables that determined the size of the company in terms of number of workers, the type of innovative activities they implement, the budget that invest in technology, the preferences in the area in which they innovate and the existing relationships between what they invest and the technological innovations carried out in a sample of ten companies of the city. The results of this exercise show that more than half of the companies belonging to the sample are medium-sized enterprises, and only 40% of them develop activities focused on technological innovation, preferably involving marketing and design actions, investing quantities that are reflected in the organizational development.Introduction: Knowledge management on R+D groups in Colombian Public Universities is based on the human capital\\'s strength involved in the company\\'s work dynamics; in this sense, to integrate theoretical and epistemological basis derive from theories of Tinoco & Soler (2011); Cabello et al.

A descriptive, non- experimental, study with on field design. It also uses the survey as a technique, and a scalar Likert type questionnaire, applied to researchers of R+D groups as an instrument. A test population was constituted by four R+D groups of public universities, Uniguajira, Magdalena, Popular del Cesar and Antioquia from Colombia. The whole referenced population was approached; therefore, we used the population census. Arias (2006). Results. Results were analyzed using descriptive statistics. The main results were: first, researchers\\' experiences, that positively influence on the productivity of the research group; second, the knowledge, result of continuous training programs that forms researchers, and third the creativity and innovation, because only 50% of researchers provide new ideas and are satisfied with innovation program policies. Conclusion. With this research, we contributed to strengthen Colombian public universities R+D groups, their continuing training programs, policies and innovation programs that increase creativity and innovation in researchers.This article aims to analyze the culture of innovation and endogenous development in the management of universities in Santa Marta, Colombia. The methodology used was under the paradigm of positivist, nonexperimental, transectional, descriptive and field research. As a tool for data collection, a questionnaire was used with 48-item Likert responses validated by seven experts in the area. The results of this research indicate that endogenous development is the spiritual force in university management which takes culture and technology as support for a process of economic growth and structural change. It is also inferred that among the aspects of the innovation culture in university management, the corporate style adopted by management facilitates the exchange of ideas among employees, recognizes innovative employees allowing them to develop their leadership skills.The City of Knowledge Foundation (CoKF) of Panama has raised the need to use foresight as a strategy for identifying technological and innovation opportunities in priority issues (Water management, Education and Health) for Panamanian society on the horizon year 2040.

Despite all this, there are aspects -such as digital divide- that occur again, to a greater or lesser extent, in the different Latin American countries. This digital divide promotes partially disconnected -and thus, invisible- societies, and tends to slow down possibilities of innovation and development of digital journalism. Methodology: In this study, and from the methodology proposed by Rodríguez, Codina & Pedraza (2012), we have analysed the management of interactivity in the main digital media in Mexico, Colombia and Ecuador in 2016. Results and conclusions: The results show a generally low implementation of interactivity options in digital ecosystems in these three Latin American countries. © 2017, University of La Laguna.

The theoretical investigation of the DC allows set as variables of the project: five (5) business dimensions and twenty (20) key factors. The study is set at the level of use of the method of DC in product development processes in these companies under, validating the assumptions made regarding the level of use of the key factors in this process DC. © 2017.The purpose of this article is to explore the differences in product and process innovation capabilities (ICs) and financial performance (FP) in manufacturing companies in Colombia. In the methodology, a cluster analysis was performed which identified three groups of companies with similar characteristics: innovators, explorers and stragglers. An analysis of variance (ANOVA) was also performed to establish meaningful differences in the means. The results show that for product ICs there are significant differences in the development of routines aimed at developing environmentally friendly products and improvements in design. Meanwhile, for processing ICs there are significant differences with regard to the incorporation of basic but essential business technologies and the management of interrelated technologies. However, for financial performance differences are significant in terms of sales growth and increased market share. In conclusion, the development of product and process ICs does not guarantee better results in sales growth and market share compared with smaller companies that have made less of an effort to consolidate such routines. This is probably due to other organizational capabilities that may be more decisive in the commercial success of products. © 2017.In Colombia, the Software Industry and Communication Technologies are considered a World-Class sector, and it is expected to be an economic booster. So far, this industry has performed from moderate to dynamic growth due to the strengthening of capabilities. This paper evaluates a number of combination of governmental policies such as investment in innovation capabilities as R&D, marketing and strategic management. We perform such evaluation using a System Dynamic Model through scenario analysis. We observe that a combination of such variables have positive feedback with the increase of investment level in the capabilities. © 2017.Innovation plays a key role in the economic growth of companies, sectors, and countries, sparking widespread interest in innovation research. Based on innovation literature, the present research seeks to validate the influence of innovation on the performance of exporting firms in emerging economies. This study contributes to research in the field of strategic innovation management and to practice in the design of public policy and exporting firm strategy, especially in emerging economies such as those in Latin America. The authors analyze the effects of organizational and marketing innovations (non-technological innovations) on the market performance of exporting firms through data collected in firms in fast growing South American emerging economies—Colombia, Peru, and Chile—with a final sample of 299 completed surveys and test hypotheses with Structural Equation Modeling (SEM). The results show that organizational innovations (new or improved organizational methods) have more influence on market performance than marketing innovations. These findings confirm the importance of innovative performance as a mediator between organizational innovation and market performance. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.This paper analyzes the effect of innovative activity on the growth and performance of MSMEs in the countries of the Pacific Alliance (PA). In order to do it, an empirical study with a sample of 386 companies from Chile, Colombia, Mexico and Peru was conducted. The methodology of multiple linear regressions by Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) was applied to verify the relationships observed. The results show that innovation in products, processes and management has a positive impact on the growth of employment and sales, also on profits. These results are particularly significant in PA\\'s countries of and can help entrepreneurs, governments and academia to promote actions that encourage business innovation and competitiveness. © 2016 Universidad ICESI.

The methodology used comprised three phases, phase 1 were revised sources such as the AENOR UNE 166002, the Colombian Technical Standard NTC 5801 and aspects suggested by the CDT Technological Development Corporation of Chile, Phase II materialized through four stages: the first involves the commitment of top management, communication to members of the company on the R & D + i, designation of team leaders, implementation of workshops on issues and project initiatives, opportunities related to R & D + from environmental analysis, monitoring of technological lookouts, in the second phase the objectives, functions and structure of the R + D + i are defined from the opportunities identified in the workshops and training and self-diagnostic capabilities applied in management of R & D + i, stage 3 includes the transfer of knowledge on tools for calculating the inflection point in models S-curves in the life cycle of technology as well as the procedure for specialized patent databases European data search, Japanese, German and WIPO -World intellectual property and scientific articles in Scopus, the fourth stage provides for the participation in technological surveillance exercises that can generate useful results to new equipment or units of R & D + i. Finally, Phase III was carried out through the application of the model generated in two companies Pilot software-technology and manufacturing sector. As for companies in the manufacturing and software industry - technology, the percentage of organizations that do not have drive R & D + i is 87.5% and 77.5% respectively, these organizations have deficiencies in factors such as conducting technological surveillance studies, open innovation processes, absorptive capacity and implementation of innovation management models that allow units successfully develop R & D + i, as pilots, are highlighted in the results execution of victories in the short term, what captivates the entrepreneur and motivate the team, likewise, entrepreneurs highlight the process that are oriented towards the generation of ideas by different members of the organization and the analysis of the environment with a better outlook for the generation of innovations in the company is obtained.The evolution of global trends characterized by economic, social and political openness, driving innovation management as a dynamic hub for the competitiveness and sustainability of small and medium Colombian enterprises (SMEs). This article aims to describe the management of innovation in small and medium enterprises in the service sector in the city of Barranquilla. The focus was quantitative with a type descriptive, cross-sectional research, using as a technique for data collection, application of a structured questionnaire to one intentional and probabilistic sample of 80 companies in the services sector. The results show that 50% of SMEs Innovation is associated with the development of new products and services, there being a responsible person who manages and allocates tasks based on your criteria and market requirement. It was concluded that innovation management requires clearly defined processes and planned in relation to the inclusion of the same innovation in administrative practices, aspect that leads to a major upgrade and professionalize responsible managers, and staff that composes.This product is the partial result of the project: “Management biotech for the Department of Magdalena Colombia”. a systematic review of the literature where the characterization of the situation problem associated with the need to create for the Colombian agribusiness sector, specifically for the Department of Magdalena, a management model that approximates historical, conceptual, theoretical and operationally arises is done the resolution of the main challenges, constraints and threats detected from the theory and praxis.

The type of study is descriptive, of a correlational nature, for which information was obtained from 640 managers of the companies mentioned. The results indicate that a low percentage (27%) of companies comprehensively undertakes knowledge management and that from such administration only the activity of using knowledge has a direct and significant relationship with the companies\\' operative and financial outcome. It is concluded that the practice of knowledge management (KM) refers more to training people, the traditional role of management, than to training for creating knowledge that enables building differentiating capabilities and innovation by the business. This tendency of the analyzed companies to be traditional and conservative hinders their own ability to respond adequately to the challenges of the new increasingly globalized, competitive, changing and uncertain economic order.The organizational structure is a subject of high academic interest because of its relationship with the strategy and other business aspects, so the aim of this work is to determine the impact of the departmentalization on innovation of micro, small, and medium enterprises in Colombia, specifically on products/services, processes, management and globally. To do that, an empirical, transversal and inferential study with linear regressions was conducted with 1201 managers of these organizations, who were asked about the number of departments and innovation in their firms. The results show the organizations studied in a medium level of departmentalization and confirm the positive impact of specialization in the structure on the different types of innovation analyzed (except for processes). It is concluded that the Academia and development agencies should support companies in their process of departmentalization, balancing costs and benefits. © 2016, Universidad del Zulia.

Copyright © 2016 International Business Information Management AssociationObjective To identify the familiarization, conceptualization and incorporation of employees of medium and high complexity health institutions in the Valle de Aburrá, Colombia into the strategic knowledge management platform in 2011. Methodology Cross sectional study. The study was carried out by applying surveys to 224 employees to assess knowledge management. The population included staff who working in the Health Providing Institutions (IPS) of high (52) and medium complexity (322) in the Valle de Aburrá in 2011. Results In both the public and private institutions surveyed, 38.8 % of the respondents said they were not familiar with knowledge management. Among those who had administrative training, the ignorance was less than among care workers. It was also noted that as the level of education increased, knowledge of the concept was greater. A high proportion (65.2 %) of respondents placed the concept in line with the creation, organization, storage, retrieval, transfer and application of knowledge systematically. 78.7 % of respondents from public institutions said that knowledge management was part of the strategic platform of the institution. 58.3 % from private institutions said the same. Conclusions In general terms the concept of knowledge management is not well conceived or familiar to the staff working in these institutions. The study confirmed a lack of empowerment in the field to promote the development of new ideas and to ensure that they become service innovations or processes that contribute to the development of institutional knowledge. © 2016, Universidad Nacional de Colombia.

The aim of the Delphi method was to identify and prioritize innovations, new business and diffusion strategies that were of importance in Specialty Coffees in Colombia. This study had consolidators on issues such as innovation, technology, new business and diffusion and marketing strategies. It is important to highlight that Delphi method was conducted in two rounds. Besides that, there were issues with consensus percentage between 50% and 75%. For example in innovations, seals combining marketing and fermentations controlled to induce sensory profiles coffee were made; in technologies: processes and benefit roasting profiles were the subjects of greater consensus. Additionally, in \"new business\", ecotourism and eco-organic products and new lines of business in the sector of specialty coffees were prominent. Also, the diffusion strategies that could be undertaken in the sector are clipping (media monitoring) and specialized databases. Finally, in common marketing code \"4Cs\" and system clean almonds are the most important.There is much debate about how knowledge-creating institutions -such as universities, research groups and centers- should be organized, as well as about the key processes of knowledge management to be applied by research groups and the financial, human and technological resources needed to achieve high performance in research. The current work, based on a theoretical review and empirical study, aims to determine the relationship of scholarly production results obtained by research groups affiliated with universities in Colombia in terms of the variables of organizational culture, knowledge management, and technological capital. For this analysis, a sample was obtained of 223 research groups that are recognized and categorized by the National Administrative Department of Science, Technology and Innovation (Colciencias, 2010). The data analyzed were obtained from a survey that measured the perception of leading researchers about such independent variables as university culture, knowledge management processes, and technological capital. The dependent variable of scientific production was analyzed based on the rating assigned to each group by Colciencias for research results obtained over a period of time. The statistical techniques used in this study are regression analysis and structural equation analysis by which it was determined that the following variables have a positive influence on the results of scholarly output: The motivating culture, process of outsourcing knowledge management, and technological capital. © 2016 CSIC.Purpose. Develop a model based on a frame logic to quantify SMEs\\' internationalization by integrating linguistic variables such as human talent, infrastructure, innovation strategies, FTAs, marketing strategy and finance, among others. It is argued that the company management of international markets depends on internal factors, especially the capabilities and resources available, based on the premise that the profits made by a company depend on external factors (competitive environmental features) and internal factors (the integration of resources available), those latter are perhaps this research\\'s biggest challenge, because it is required to propose a suitable battery of capabilities and define their importance and strategic relevance to building competitive advantages. Design/ Methodology/Approach. Fuzzy inference system is proposed to model the resources, skills and competencies that determine internationalisation success. Data: 157 linguistic variables are used, arisen from entrepreneurs, experts, consultants and researchers in international trade, and through expert judgment, 18 factors explaining export capabilities are defined. The proposed model is applied by means of a case study of the textile and clothing cluster in Medellin, Colombia. Findings. In model\\'s implementing it got a particular global index of 28.2 for internationalisation capabilities. The result confirms the hypothesis that the capabilities and resources currently available to the sector analyzed, are not sufficient for a successful integration into the international market, and most importantly, specifies the factors and variables to intervene to improve the export\\'s capability. Limitations. In the particular case of textile companies, is highlighted the lack of a continuous information record and very few studies directed towards the long-term plans development. Similarly, there is little consistency in the exports criteria. Originality/Value. Method emerges as an innovative management tool, linked to internal organizational spheres and their different abilities.This article shows the results of the measurement of innovation capabilities in 460 organizations from various economic sectors of Quindío - Colombia. The methodology used was based on the application of a modified test of innovation capabilities, which contains six factors or axes related to innovation capabilities, the top five factors were: innovation strategy, deployment of the innovation strategy, innovation culture, innovation in the value chain, innovation results and a sixth and final factor control used related to the alignment of future studies; innovation strategy and a management innovation model, this was done in order to compare the results of the first factors. Data was obtained through statistical sampling of the total amount of companies of the Department, obtaining a value of 460 companies, which administered the test and the results were treated through descriptive statistics and a multivariable analysis of the score on the test; regarding the variables of each factor. Among the most significant results observed were the measurement of the first five factors that show an innovation capability between excellent and good; 52%. However, companies in the region scored negatively, totally or partially, in aspects related to the control factor; which concluded that 72% of the companies in the region do not ensure surveillance studies. 74% of the companies have not participated in open innovation processes, 80% do not count with an R+D+I unit, 71% of the same have not done foresight studies, 59% have nor formulated or implemented an innovation strategy; and 71% of these companies do not count with an innovation model, innovation management model, or innovation management system.This paper presents the relationship between understood as a content that facilitates decision making and strategic management in organizations and its subsequent transformation to a strategy of organizational innovation strategy, taking into account the dynamic capabilities and the three elements of a strategy corporate innovation and competitive national position, technological trajectories and organizational and management processes; through a qualitative research surveyed 262 companies in Colombia was applied in order to identify the level of development of their innovation strategies, key findings show that the strategic direction of investment in R + D + i, It is critical for organizational innovation strategy and lack of management demands greater efforts in organizational planning. There is evidence that companies in the country have been working on projects for knowledge management, creativity, talent and innovation projects, ie are traveling the road to innovation management, which in the medium term may become results Early that generates changes in their production systems and help rethink the strategic direction to preserve the positioning face new competitors.Colombian Higher Education Enterprise Architecture is a framework for managing the system-of-systems lifecycle of Higher Education Programs. With this framework is possible to model scenarios about the government as a regulator of Higher Education services, the educational institutions as providers of higher education services and the different business and social sectors, and individual citizens as clients of higher education services. Under this perspective all the stakeholders can participate in the planning, development, transfer, use and control of all the products and services lifecycles of higher education in order to prioritize improvement alternatives and measure progress when it is moving towards excellence in training processes, research, innovation, development and knowledge transfer. CHE2A is a supportive environment for the management of higher education as a public service, which hosts the vision of \\'Global Coalition Intelligent Network Services (-GIUNC-) to analyze and evaluate systematic, systemic and logistically, the characteristics of processes, outputs and outcomes and risks through key factors such as those proposed by the - GIUNC- itself, Registry of Qualification established by the Ministry of Education of Colombia or other similar factors established by national or international entities, from which, the stakeholders in the Higher Education services, interpret, evaluate, argue, propose, define, plan, implement and measure strategies, tactics and actions for improvement, innovation and development higher education programs. CHE2A is a knowledge management system that is enriched by the experience of organizations and supports innovation in higher education toward a high performance service. The approach set CHE2A does not advocate specific tools, methods or practices, but promotes a new way of thinking, to solve the great challenges of the interactions of technology, power, politics and economics made involves the general study design, complexity and systems engineering. Although these systems often exhibit behaviors systems of complex systems, however, not all complex problems fall within the scope of systems of systems. This article presents the context, perspective and use of CHE2A through its models ontological, epistemological, methodological and regulatory that allow navigate the life cycles of products and services offered by higher education institutions and all those entities benefiting from this results achieved. © 2015 IEEE.Constant changes in technology pose continuous challenges for higher education institutions that are training the engineers of the future. These changes are making it necessary to adapt the curriculum in order to develop the skills needed by the XXI century engineer. Moreover, instead of thinking in a large curriculum reform at a specific moment, it is necessary to define curriculum management processes that include change as a natural component of the process. In addition to these global trends, each institution has a particular context and thus, the analysis in each institution has unique characteristics, a common methodological approach, and a reference model that can be built as long as it is flexible enough to include that context. This paper describes a model developed for curriculum management inside the School of Engineering at Universidad EAFIT - Colombia. This model includes the institutional context and is based on a process approach defined by the Business Process Management (BPM) methodology. The model uses the Burlton Hexagon as a theoretical framework to identify organizational structure, strategies, policies, infrastructure, technology tools and human capital. It is also a mechanism for specifying curricular macro processes including the global and institutional context. The proposed model is based on three pillars: (a) scientific research in education, which promotes the use of the scientific method as a strategy to ensure an approach to problems based on evidence which allows the construction of educational innovation projects, (b) education engineering focused on engineering education, which transforms the learning by developing basic, professional, and transversal skills as well as those specific for an engineer of the XXI century, and (c) interactive educational communities, both face to face and virtual, as spaces for knowledge management that support collaborative working and experience-sharing, managed by its members working together promoting initiatives to develop educational innovation projects focused on specific topics, that answer questions related to teaching and learning needs. The formulation and development of educational innovation projects are the responses to different needs identified on specific courses that are transformed into research questions. These projects aim to renew the curriculum so that it dynamically evolves based on classroom experiences. Thus, the curriculum renewal is based on critical thinking about the problems found in engineering education. The use of the scientific method and the collaborative approach enables drawing solid conclusions based on the experimental results. The model proposes the formulation and development of innovative educational projects in which scientific research applied in education aims to transform teaching, academic and administrative practices. As consequence, curricular innovations that integrate learning objects and educational, methodological and assessment strategies, are developed by an interactive learning community composed by teachers. Finally, the results obtained by applying the model in some courses in the School of Engineering of Universidad EAFIT are presented. These results include reducing the drop-out rate of students, redefining admission and graduation profiles, and micro-curricular redesign based on competences using projects, among others. © 2014 IEEE.The aim of the paper is to propose answers to the research question: What are the variables associated with knowledge management, which are conducted by the research groups of higher education institutions -HEI- in Colombia? This problem was identified by analyzing two major tensions. First, between the socially relevant knowledge and knowledge required by the market; and second, between the social research and research oriented by science, technology and innovation. These tensions put the knowledge management, which are conducted by the research groups, at the center of analysis. The methodology used is a case study of a qualitative and descriptive type, for which interviews and analysis of the curriculum vitae of directors and members of research groups were conducted. Review of literature on knowledge management was made, and research done on this topic by HEI. The findings are shown in three groups of variables associated with knowledge management: a) the research structure: planning, resource management, openness to change, leadership, teamwork, initiative, partnership, research training and employment; b) the research process: the problem and research questions, hypotheses, methodology, analysis and interpretation of results, participation in calls, regulation, research platforms and academic production; and c) the innovation process: prospective vision, interaction with the environment, creativity and use of information technologies. The findings indicate that the knowledge management in research groups, should be redirected through institutional policies articulated to the scientific and technological development. Although research groups perform activities resulting from the model of knowledge management (socialization, outsourcing, combination, and internationalization), these are not always practiced in a conscious way; and they also have structural difficulties during the research process, hindering the transfer of knowledge. Taking into account that HEI have integrated management systems that support the research process, it still requires improving the quality of these stages of management. The usefulness of the results leads to rethink policies that guide the processes of institutional research, and redirect knowledge management that is performed from the research groups. This for to move from the structuring of research problems arising from a weak conception of knowledge, to others where sociocultural realities are the benchmark for its formulation. Also aims to consolidate knowledge management from improving academic productivity of research groups, despite the risks of productivism. This is because the productivism is characterized by the proliferation of scientific papers based on the logic of the stacking, but, not of the knowledge creation and its social relevance.. Such practices transformed the publication, which it is a byproduct of the research, in a order of itself.This research is focused on which are the enabler and inhibitor factors that influence the knowledge management practices by research groups in a Colombian university. It considers also the influence of the Colombia\\'s National System of Science, Technology and Innovation in the research groups to manage their knowledge. The methodology used in this study is based on the grounded theory. The data were collected through in depth-interviews addressed to research group\\'s coordinators, who where selected according to different criteria to obtain diversity of contexts. The results confirm the factors identified in the literature, and besides two more factors are identified as inhibitor to knowledge management in research groups: time employed in other tasks and the quantity of persons designated to investigate. From the results obtained, and as future line of research, it is suggested to deeply study the knowledge cycle\\'s activities, taking into account the enablers and inhibitors factors identified.In this century, organizations must read and understand their environment, develop compatible capabilities and transform if necessary to adapt to the new rules of the game of value and take appropriate decisions that will maintain them in the future. The ability to generate knowledge-based value not only depends on the individual company, but also depends largely on the ability to generate value of both the sector to which the company belongs and the economy of the native country. This document is the result of the analysis of the signals of the sector, second component of the preliminary stage of the DECK Study carried out by Bio Gerencia Virtual®. The main official sources of the food and beverage industry in Colombia were analyzed to detect the potential of this industry to create value by transforming knowledge into innovation. From analysis of the industry variables, signals that can become the basis for indicators are identified and propose a path of positive development for the sector: Transforming a traditional sector into one driven by knowledge. Peter M. Senge and others have referred to the deep learning cycle as the essence of the learning organization. When major changes are required, a deep learning cycle operates and can happen individually or collectively. In the Paisa Culture Prototype, a prototype of Knowledge Management for Innovation, whose base is the DECK Study, analyzes of specific sectors of the Colombian economy is included. If we understand each sector as a team able to create what it wants to create, the deep learning cycle will be relevant to each economic sector. In particular, the food and beverage industry of Colombia depends largely on the rich biodiversity of Colombia. The greatest opportunities for the sector can be found in the governmental purpose of transforming the Colombian industry. The food sector is at the center of this transformation; but, according to the findings, if the deep learning cycle is not activated, the transformation will not occur; and therefore neither will there be knowledgebased innovation. If the sector does not renew its thought model, it will not become an innovative sector. In the second part of the document, and with the representation of information of the business learning loop proposed by Haeckel and Nolan, work fronts in the sector are derived and some considerations are presented, taking into account issues of learning required to implement a traditional industry to become an innovative industry driven by knowledge. The outline of the document provides elements that are confined to the Detect Function and Interpret Function within the business learning loop. This cycle serves as a starting point to understand the deep learning cycle. It also refers to the collective learning that is perceived from the analysis that will be needed to increase the ability to compete in the sector.In the current competitive environment, logistics has been considered one of the key elements that allows growth strategies for countries and companies. Emerging economies such as Colombia have implemented different plans to achieve sustainable development and technology advantages for the national firm\\'s supply chain, but sometimes the region characteristics difficult the creation of networks. This inconvenient leads to the question: how can viable tactics lead companies to affront management logistic challenges in developing countries? The present paper introduces a proposal that contributes in the search of a possible solution in the Fast-Moving Consumer Goods (FMCG) industry case in Colombia and similar regions. In first place, this paper presents the general variables that are affecting the management of logistic networks in Colombia based on specialized literature. After this, a Colombian FMCG corporation is studied in order to develop a simulation model and identify possible opportunities and solutions. Finally, relations between the results of the case study and the impact that would be generated through a general proposal for the country and comparable areas is established. As a result of this work, the status of Colombian logistics is evidenced, as well as the future perspectives and opportunities of strengthening in the management of networks in the country. Additionally, this investigation seeks to promote the discussion around possible applications and systems to increase the present performance in the FMCG business. People, organizations and productive sectors constantly need to update their methods and technology according to their objectives. The study aims to provide a divulgation space of experiences and impacts, and give logistics practitioners the opportunity to adapt the knowledge and strengthen the development of sustainable innovation for competitiveness. It is expected that over the years, the implementation of new procedures can be expanded to remote regions.

One of the factors is technology given that it contributes to the achievement of the proposed business results, therefore, the aim of the present study consist of verifying if the acquisition of information technology generates innovation benefits for the Colombian enterprises; furthermore, analyzes its importance as an input to the definition of organizational strategy. In order to do so, a statistic correlation exercise between the variables of technology an innovation acquisition and elements of the II Development and Technological Innovation Survey in Colombia was made, indicating if dependence between the variables results exists. As a main conclusion, the technology acquisition in Colombia is not an active part of the organizational strategy or its use has been oriented to activities which do not generate competitive advantage. This study is intended to contribute to the management process development in the companies of the country. © 2015, Universidad del Zulia.

A qualitative case was carried out to analyze the directors’ perceptions in six hospitals with and without DRGs in Bogotá. The interviews are based on the Innovation Diffusion Theory. The directors had similar perceptions of the determinates. DRGs were seen as positive, but encountered organizational and institutional obstacles. Without a targeted public policy, the likelihood of implementing DRGs in Colombia is slight. © 2015, Fundacao Oswaldo Cruz.

Based on this revision, its problems were identified, and one of them related to the non-structure structuring of problems of human activity was analyzed. With the end of complementing the analysis, a case of the application of soft system methodology was made, conceived in the 1960\\'s by Peter Checkland in a Doctoral dissertation related to the Delphi method and its alignment with an innovation strategy in the frame of a management innovation model; with the purpose of generating a solved problem. Amongst the main conclusions, the advantages of the use of a soft system methodology were highlighted to help the improvement of non-structured human activity with the Delphi method, and its alignment with the company\\'s innovation strategy in the frame of innovation management models. Also, the possibility of complementing the soft system methodology with priority surveys to obtain expert opinion related with the components of a Doctoral dissertation.This paper describes how a born global firm goes into international market from inception at its early years. The objective of this paper is to analyze from the resource-based theory how a born global firm engages in international market. This empirical investigation has been carried out as an explorative single-case study, a high-tech firm, Digital Partner, based in Medellin, Antioquia. The main findings of the research show that organizational capabilities based on intellectual capital are crucial for the development of a born global. Thus, capabilities such as entrepreneurship, global vision, internationally market knowledge, learning management, IT capabilities, technological innovation, collaborative work, networks and customer orientation are recurrent and they correspond to other similar research results. Contributions of the study are both academic (for the advance of the research in born global field) and practical (for the design of governmental policies to foster born global firms). © Universidad Alberto Hurtado, Facultad de Economía y Negocios.This paper describes the design and implementation of the National Laboratory of Smart Grids in the University Campus (LAB+i) with the real-time integration of electricity, water and/or gas systems through six layers of Smart Grids that allow to make measurement of a process, local or remote communication in order to be integrated to the supervision and management system. Likewise in the following layers of the LAB+i, information management processes, decision making, modeling of systems and processes that enable the development of optimum efficiency and productivity applications are made. LAB+i is designed as a testing platform of technologies associated with Smart Grids, developing prototypes of measurement systems and communication drivers related to Smart Grids for Smart Cities. Finally, the research capacities, technology and innovation development are presented, which the LAB+i laboratory would allow to include the incorporation of local business pilot projects to be optimized, adaptive technology testing, evaluation of local environmental conditions and their requirements. © 2014 IEEE.Innovation and technology, in appropriate business environments, are considered improvement and survival tools directly related to the establishment of competitive advantages. However, this must be accompanied by a growing economy, and, in some cases, governmental policies that encourage the industry. This chapter inquires about several factors involved in the innovation and technological change of the pork industry in Antioquia, Colombia, based on original research results and other contributions of the authors. The managerial assumption is simple: free trade and strategic moves of the biggest competitors indicate that Small- and Medium-Sized Enterprises (SMEs) in the pork industry must accelerate their technological change via innovation management by addressing different factors that are hindering the establishment of competitive advantages. The authors offer a possible path of action from a management perspective to support that the industry will form an oligopoly should innovation management not occur. © 2014 by IGI Global.

However, to date, few studies have been made regarding the capacities for innovation underlying their good results in developing new and improved products. The objective of this article is to determine the maturity ofthe innovation capacities for five ofthese companies. The theoretical model of Essmann and Du Preez (2009) was used, which consists ofthree dimensions: a construct for innovation capacity, a maturity scale and an organizational construct. In terms of methodology, an index of innovative capacity was constructed and the ranges for three maturity levels were calculated, using the analysis cluster (Jung et al, 2009); this permitted classifying the companies under study. Results show that all the companies have a maturity level titled formalized and predictable. In conclusion, although the best practices associated with each innovation capacity have been identified and implemented, individuals have not appropriated them and do not use them in a systematic manner. © 2014, Universidad del Zulia.

Taking into account that 98% of the Colombian enterprises are SMEs, from which 5% invest only 2% of its annual budget in design, the National Industrial Design Program (MinCIT) saw the need to develop the Integral Design Tutoring Model. The model makes a bet for empathy and emotional intimacy as tools to transfer the necessary knowledge so that the local businessperson develops an innovation culture based on design thinking. To test the model, the Integral Design Tutoring Project was developed as a pilot. This fourmonths project allowed an interdisciplinary team, conducted by designers, to accompany twenty SMEs. Through a process developed in three stages it was possible to prove that, through empathy and emotional intimacy, one can achieve knowledge transfer to business people and their organizations in an effective, efficient and successful way. This knowledge transfer allows the organization to develop human centered design processes in a systematic, independent and autonomous way.Introduction Standardized trauma protocols (STP) have reduced morbidity and in-hospital mortality in mature trauma systems. Most hospitals in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) have not implemented STPs, often because of financial and logistic limitations. We report the impact of an STP designed for the care of trauma patients in the emergency department (ED) at an LMIC hospital on patients with severe traumatic brain injury (STBI). Methods We developed an STP based on generally accepted best practices and damage control resuscitation for a level I trauma centre in Colombia. Without a pre-existing trauma registry, we adapted an administrative electronic database to capture clinical information of adult patients with TBI, a head abbreviated injury score (AIS) ≥3, and who presented ≤ 12 h from injury. Demographics, mechanisms of injury, and injury severity were compared. Primary outcome was in-hospital mortality. Secondary outcomes were Glasgow Coma Score (GCS), length of hospital and ICU stay, and prevalence of ED interventions recommended in the STP. Logistic regression was used to control for potential confounders. Results The pre-STP group was hospitalized between August 2010 and August 2011, the post-STP group between September 2011 and June 2012. There were 108 patients meeting inclusion criteria, 68 pre-STP implementation and 40 post-STP. The pre- and post-STP groups were similar in age (mean 37.1 vs. 38.6, p = 0.644), head AIS (median 4.5 vs. 4.0, p = 0.857), Injury Severity Scale (median 25 vs. 25, p = 0.757), and initial GCS (median 7 vs. 7, p = 0.384). Post-STP in-hospital mortality decreased (38% vs. 18%, p = 0.024), and discharge GCS increased (median 10 vs. 14, p = 0.034). After controlling for potential confounders, odds of in-hospital mortality post-STP compared to pre-STP were 0.248 (95%CI: 0.074-0.838, p = 0.025). Hospital and ICU stay did not significantly change. The use of many ED interventions increased post-STP, including bladder catheterization (49% vs. 73%, p = 0.015), hypertonic saline (38% vs. 63%, p = 0.014), arterial blood gas draws (25% vs. 43%, p = 0.059), and blood transfusions (3% vs. 18%, p = 0.008). Conclusions An STP in an LMIC decreased in-hospital mortality, increased discharge GCS, and increased use of vital ED interventions for patients with STBI. An STP in an LMIC can be implemented and measured without a pre-existing trauma registry. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.Background: Several studies have explored the effect of the presence of medical students on patient satisfaction. However, nearly all of these studies took place in hospitals where medical students had been involved in patient care for many years. Less is known about patients\\' perceptions of care in a hospital moving toward becoming a teaching facility with undergraduate students. No research has explored patient satisfaction before and after the introduction of medical students. Objective: To assess patient satisfaction as an indicator of quality of care (QoC) from the patients\\' perspective, before and after the presence of medical students in a general hospital setting. Methods: This observational, cross-sectional study was conducted at Hospital Universitario-Fundación Santa Fe de Bogotá (HU-FSFB) in Bogotá, Colombia. The study had two phases. In 2006, prior to HU-FSBF becoming a teaching hospital, 385 subjects were asked to fill out a closed-question questionnaire addressing patients\\' satisfaction and perception of QoC provided by attending physicians. During the second period in 2009, 372 patients answered the same questionnaire when medical students were involved in their care. Results: Patients\\' perceptions of QoC provided by attending physicians improved in five aspects when medical students were present: friendliness (p = 0.003), competence providing medical care (p = 0.049), quality of information provided (p = 0.025), amount of time spent with the patient (p < 0.001) and availability to personally provide care (p < 0.001). Overall patient satisfaction also significantly increased (p < 0.001). Conclusions: The presence of medical students does not negatively affect patients\\' perceptions of QoC, on the contrary, these results provide evidence of improved patient satisfaction in several aspects of care when medical students were involved. The relevance of this study lies in its unique way of comparing patient satisfaction before and after the introduction of medical students. This setting helps elucidate the real effect of the presence of medical students on patient satisfaction. © 2014 Informa UK Ltd.

Taking as input the innovative profile of the methodological tool, developed by the research group in \\'Policy and Management of Technology\\' from The Pontificia Bolivariana University: \\'Technology Management Methodology for Project\\' (MGT), applied to 176 companies. This approach was conducted through a series of tests of hypotheses focused on measuring variables like, \\'diffusion of innovation\\', \\'know-how\\', \\'competitive technical intelligence\\', \\'employees with technology training\\' and \\'experimental development budget for R & D + I\\', among other. According to these approaches, the states of the innovation, key factors to the analyzed firms in each region, were validated. Statistical models, critical z and percentage distribution, were used to validate the hypotheses, by means of which it was possible to identify weak key factors and opportunities in the various departments analyzed. © 2013 PICMET.Silvopastoral systems (SPS) enhance milk and meat production and are instrumental for the productive rehabilitation of degraded lands. Intensive silvopastoral systems (ISPS) combine fodder shrubs planted at high densities (&gt;10,000 plants ha-1), trees and pastures. Scaling-up such systems requires incentives to address financial and knowledge barriers. In Colombia, the strategy for scaling-up SPS has combined five elements. First, participatory research on real farms contributed to optimize SPS in different agroecosystems and strengthened a network of pilot farms open to research and peer-to-peer technology transfer. Second, capacity building, training, and outreach activities spread the principles of SPS among farmers, field workers, researchers, extension workers, and policy makers. Third, pilot projects explored the role of incentives such as Payment for Environmental Services (PES), technical assistance, soft loans and bonus prices, in spreading SPS. Fourth, successful pilot projects were instrumental in influencing the livestock sector as well as the public policy agenda. Fifth, currently, large-scale projects aimed at mainstreaming SPS are applying the lessons learned in order to achieve landscape-scale benefits, enhance climate change adaptation and mitigation, and introduce SPS products to green markets. Recently, innovation networks have contributed to speed up the adaptation of SPS in different environmental and socioeconomic contexts. © 2013 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.The technology of energy management called \"Sistema de Gestión Integral de la Energía, SGIE\" was proposed in Colombia in 2007 as a result of a research project funded by the government. The SGIE technology consists of statistical and monitoring tools, energy efficiency indicators and conforms to the requirements of the Standard ISO 50001. This paper presents a pilot scheme for the implementation of the SGIE technology in a cement industry with wet process, in order to improve its energy efficiency. The results have shown a reduction of 4.6% of the electric energy consumption in this factory, achieved without investing in new equipment, only with the innovation of the processes through applying technologies of energy management. The implementation of the SGIE has contributed to the adoption of an energy efficient management\\'s culture and continuous improvement of the processes with impact on productivity and competitiveness of the company.The collective construction process allowed, from the selection of 4 projects articulators under BIO trends in the region, building strategic and concept of each project notes articulator strategic Units-UEA-analysis in each case, project identification of various levels of complexity, and a common agenda for joint construction in the first phase of five years.

Knowledge management involves generating conditions for the creation and exchange of knowledge, to support these processes is necessary to articulate organizational systems that promote the activation of endogenous and intangible capitals, such as knowledge. Under this theoretical conception, a Local System of Innovation (L.S.I) is built for Agrópolis del Norte, for the purpose of stimulate integrating and mobilizing dynamics for social actors of nine municipalities in north Valle del Cauca (Colombia), which constitute the Agrópolis del Norte, towards development of financial and non-financial capital through knowledge management. © Universidad Alberto Hurtado, Facultad de Economía y Negocios.Knowledge about the extent of irrigated land in Colombia is scarce because most irrigation is done informally and therefore not registered. Informal irrigation in Colombia has not been investigated, its national presence has not been identified, and its characteristics are still unknown. The present article aims to help fill this gap. Because of topographical and agricultural patterns, Andean informal irrigation is impossible to identify or characterize using standard methods. To provide information on the scale of informal irrigation systems in Colombia, their type, the users they serve, and the type of water sources they use, a large-scale partial inventory was made combining statistical analysis, questionnaires, interviews, and field trips. The findings indicate that informal irrigation is widespread in the country\\'s mountainous zones, in a great diversity of environments, characterized by an equally great diversity of local uses and water-use strategies. This diversity has resulted from the coexistence of very different community and state institutions, posing challenges for planning and organizing water-resource management more efficiently and sustainably for producers, the government, and other stakeholders.Introduction: Few studies have assessed the nature and quality of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC). Methods and Findings: The aims of this systematic review are to evaluate the characteristics (including the risk of bias assessment) of RCT conducted in LAC according to funding source. A review of RCTs published in 2010 in which the author\\'s affiliation was from LAC was performed in PubMed and LILACS. Two reviewers independently extracted data and assessed the risk of bias. The primary outcomes were risk of bias assessment and funding source. A total of 1,695 references were found in PubMed and LILACS databases, of which 526 were RCTs (N = 73.513 participants). English was the dominant publication language (93%) and most of the RCTs were published in non-LAC journals (84.2%). Only five of the 19 identified countries accounted for nearly 95% of all RCTs conducted in the region (Brazil 70.9%, Mexico 10.1%, Argentina 5.9%, Colombia 3.8%, and Chile 3.4%). Few RCTs covered priority areas related with Millennium Development Goals like maternal health (6.7%) or high priority infectious diseases (3.8%). Regarding children, 3.6% and 0.4% RCT evaluated nutrition and diarrhea interventions respectively but none pneumonia. As a comparison, aesthetic and sport related interventions account for 4.6% of all trials. A random sample of RCTs (n = 358) was assessed for funding source: exclusively public (33.8%); private (e.g. pharmaceutical company) (15.3%); other (e.g. mixed, NGO) (15.1%); no funding (35.8%). Overall assessments for risk of bias showed no statistically significant differences between RCTs and type of funding source. Statistically significant differences favoring private and others type of funding was found when assessing trial registration and conflict of interest reporting. Conclusion: Findings of this study could be used to provide more direction for future research to facilitate innovation, improve health outcomes or address priority health problems. © 2013 Reveiz et al.This article proposes a methodology to evaluate Technological Innovation Capabilities at university institutions, seeking to strengthen innovation management and advance in the integration of said institutions in the dynamics of the innovation system. The Triple Helix Model is adopted to analyze the relationships of university institutions with their surroundings. The proposal is conceptually built on a based on the perspective of resources and capabilities and on to the systemic congruence model of the organization. A fuzzy inference system is developed as the mathematical support of the evaluation process of the Technological Innovation Capabilties. The methodology is experimentally applied to a university institution in Medellín - Colombia, demonstrating its consistency, viability and practical usefulness. © Universidad Alberto Hurtado, Facultad de Economía y Negocios.The Higher Education Institutions, HEI are the natural space where the ethos of knowledge can be developed and the Intellectual Capital, IK can be accumulated. It\\'s no secret the inadequacy of the Management Information Systems, MIS to incorporate knowledge. In fact is shared by many authors that well over half the market value is explained by the IK in companies of the Third Millennium. Traditional systems do not account for the IK and only estimate the book values vs. market values when selling focused on negotiation processes. On the other hand, there are already quite a few financial models of the knowledge economy that considers the IK. For the universities is a critical issue in the way of the Competitiveness of Higher Education. Our initiative EIDOS constituted unconventional ideas that have not had an audience in the context of Colombia. Now beginning to break through what an open space is required with basic units in the enterprise architecture of the HEI focused on innovation; This was stated by the Government Plan 2010-2014, in this country as an national strategy. These new architectures must be defined and supported in order to facilitate the stream of information and knowledge with new sources of generation, especially those where the IK did not exist. It begins to think that IK is the basis of sustainability and financial governance. Knowledge Engineering (KE) maturity level is inderway. As background it should be mentioned that this research originated to facilitate the use of development methodologies, information systems and evolve them to the incorporation of layers of knowledge for an Intelligent Management Information IMIS, to the various organizational and technological changes that occur in building new systems to meet customer requirements in improvement of processes, new demands of companies in the Knowledge Society and basically make the intelligent performance of the firm. Our research effort represents ongoing work with several University projects and unpublished graduate works and also consulting works for institutions in Colombia. In the FESSANJOSE the model has evolved to our proposal of social innovation Leontief Model that incorporate the knowledge sector. The KE methodology is shortly presented in this paper has been an attempt for reducing the complexity involved: is part of that effort and has not obeyed to a large-scale project with good funding. They have been serene developments that we want to share with the academic community. We describe an attempt to formalize a KE methodology in 8 steps which are presented in detail, the mix of ideas coming from both Engineering and Management we tried to integrate in this construct.

Within the development of research were taken as the theoretical basis organizational learning, skills management of human talent, the models of knowledge management, technological monitoring, infrastructure knowledge, business intelligence, technology transfer and own processes of innovation and development of shipbuilding industry in design, construction and repair of ships and craft. The challenge laid out by research team was associated with the development of policies, strategies, methodologies and tools to manage knowledge, developing skills and competencies from individual experiences, group and organizational, so that short-term fostered a culture of generation innovation for competitive and comparative advantages in the sector naval. Additionally as part of the R & D. He designed a Web platform as a tool for developing knowledge management tasks, in this case communities of practice, virtual communities and knowledge networks, which is active in the organization. © 2012 IEEE.This work addresses the reform of governmental accounting in Colombia, which began in 1991 and currently continues, in order to better understand the origins and development of the Colombian Public Accounting System. One new element consists in documenting part of the process of adaptation of the International Public Sector Accounting Standards - IPSAS - to a specific context. Thus, the central question of the document is whether or not the process carried out in governmental accounting in Colombia can be viewed as an innovation. Using a descriptive and analytical approach supported by public documents and secondary sources, we characterize what has happened in accordance with the Financial Management Reform Process Model proposed by Lüder (2002). Structural, behavioral and instrumental variables that have had an effect on the process are analyzed along with the current status of the reform. Also, certain motivators and obstacles in the adoption and adaptation of such innovations as the IPSAS are identified.Subject area: Innovation and creativity in small to medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in Latin America. Study level/applicability: The case is recommended for creativity and innovation subjects, in undergraduate and MBA levels. The case is also suggested for subjects associated with the organizational dynamics on SMEs. Case overview: Colchones Eldorado is a Colombian company dedicated to the bedding industry. The company was founded in 1957 by Gumercindo Gómez Caro, a creative man who in 1959 invented a machine to make springs, which allowed the company to grow steadily for several decades. On November 18, 2004, the founder\\'s daughter, Martha Luz Gomez, was appointed as General Manager. On April 2011 it obtained a license from Sealy, the biggest mattress making company in the USA. The license implied a challenge - testing the company\\'s innovative capacities to adapt Sealy mattresses to satisfy consumers in the Colombian market. Expected learning outcomes: Students are shown the characteristics of the creative and innovation process in a Latin American SME, and the innovation challenges which are faced. From the reading and the case discussion, the students should be able to: analyse the manifestations of the creative process in an SME; identify examples of the innovation types of an SME; and discuss the organizational conditions to answer the creativity and innovation challenges in an SME.

Design/methodology/approach: A questionnaire was designed and addressed to the CEOs of the companies making up the target population (Spanish and Colombian medium-high and high technology firms with more than 50 employees and R&D activities). Structural equation modelling (SEM) based on partial least squares (PLS) was then applied to test the hypotheses drawn from the research. Findings: The results obtained show that knowledge sharing is a key issue in order to enhance innovation capability. With the exception of ICT-based knowledge sharing mechanisms (whose influence on the generation of new ideas is not statistically significant), all types of mechanism considered exert a significant impact both on ideation and on innovation project management (although their degree of relevance varies), and account for a great deal of variance in both constructs. Differences between countries arise when it comes to the influence of each first-level innovation capacity on company performance. Research limitations/implications: Traditional limitations of cross-sectional studies apply. Originality/value: The main contribution of this paper is to provide empirical evidence about the impact of knowledge sharing on innovation. Moreover, it reveals what the most effective knowledge sharing mechanisms are for this purpose and provide companies with a basic framework in order to shape their knowledge management strategies in this domain. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.The technology of energy management called \"Sistema de Gestión Integral de la Energía, SGIE\" was proposed in Colombia in 2007 as a result of a research project funded by the Colombian government. The SGIE technology consists of statistical and monitoring tools, energy efficiency indicators and conforms to the requirements of the Standard ISO 50001. This technology allows the measurement of energy efficiency on industrial processes. Since 2007, the SGIE technology has been used in diverse industrial sectors and between the years 2009 and 2010, it was applied to the cement production industry. This paper presents the results of a pilot application of the SGIE technology in a cement plant with a wet process, in order to improve its energy efficiency. The results have shown a reduction of 4.6% of the electric energy consumption in this plant; achieved without investing in new equipment, but with only the innovation of the processes through applying the SGIE technologies to the energy management of the plant processes. The implementation of the SGIE has contributed to the adoption of a culture of energy efficient management and continuous improvement of the processes with impact on productivity and competitiveness of the company. © 2012 IEEE.The objective of this project is to establish a management model for certification and recertification of professional engineering, which is required to perform the analysis of the state of knowledge of the processes of certification and recertification of professional engineering and the different studies where the relationship University - Company - State has been applied to generate results based on innovation. The scope of the project will involve the analysis of regulatory, legal and procedural in Colombia, United States, Canada, El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras, countries through which they have established free trade agreements, where the issue of mobility is essential development of skills that result in professional innovation. Develop a management model which involves the relationship University - Business-State will result in a unified methodology in the regulatory framework for certification and recertification of professional engineering. © 2012 IEEE.The social, economic, geopolitical and technological derived from the \"Knowledge Society\" are closely related and affect the ability of organizations to manage innovation. Funding in previous work, empirical and theoretical constructions, the consulting firm TEAM Ingeniería de Conocimiento in partnership with the Grupo de Investigación GEIT- UD, present a proposal to develop a new model for innovation management that responds to the obsolescence of the models (techniques, methodologies) management innovation \"traditional\" approaches, but above all the need to prepare local organizations to meet all the new needs, trends and policy framework in the short medium term intends to have more financial resources to leverage innovation projects with state funding. Innovation indicators in the regions of Colombia are not the best, in Bogotá - Cundinamarca, the region of the country with the highest rates of investment in Science, Technology and Innovation, private spending on these activities is barely a 0.5 % of sales. While progress has been made in the implementation of mechanisms to promote innovation (Agendas regional and sectoral agreements Competitiveness Foresight exercises, Network of Innovative Business, Meetings University - Business - State), the reality is there is still much to build in the capabilities of innovation in organizations in the region. The need to generate a new model of innovation management is also related to a paradigm shift in the convergence being represented ICT and Social Networks, and by extension, a set of rules associated with new forms of relationships (between individuals and organizations) , new social patterns, new forms of access and use of knowledge. The \"closed and linear schemes\" that were based on traditional innovation models today are revalued, and therefore need to \"innovate in the innovation.\".This document briefly describes the health conditions of the Colombian population and, in more detail, the characteristics of the Colombian health system. The description of the system includes its structure and coverage; financing sources; expenditure in health; physical material and human resources available; monitoring and evaluation procedures; and mechanisms through which the population participates in the evaluation of the system. Salient among the most recent innovations implemented in the Colombian health system are the modification of the Compulsory Health Plan and the capitation payment unit, the vertical integration of the health promotion enterprises and the institutions in charge of the provision of services and the mobilization of additional resources to meet the objectives of universal coverage and the homologation of health benefits among health regimes.This study involves a statistical analysis based on the results of the diagnostic strategy in innovation in 52 research groups at one university in Medellin - Colombia, to validate the currently situation of the groups towards innovation, strategies, structures of development equipments among others. The methodology was designed by the Policy and Technology Management Research Group, based on different models such as, methodology in technological management of projects, diagnosis of innovation by Albacete, Cataluña and methodology for innovation strategy by Melissa Schilling.The results offer basis for the formulation and implementation of innovative strategies in the different groups allowing the improvement in the innovation generation of products, services, processes, markets as well as to improve its competitiveness. © Universidad Alberto Hurtado, Facultad de Economía y Negocios.This paper seeks to contribute to the analysis of innovation in the Colombian industry (at group or 2-digit ISIC level) using data from the first two national innovation surveys. This is pursued by means of Innovation Indices, from which it is sought to identify regional and national special features, while allowing international comparative analysis, along the lines of the Oslo Manual. The work highlights the limitations of the information available to carry out the calculation of innovation indices as proposed in the recent literature on the subject. As an alternative, a methodology based on the Importance Value Indices (IVIs) is applied, which allows the calculation of new innovation performance indicators amenable to international comparisons. By applying multivariate statistical techniques, redundant information of a high number of variables is cleared to construct the IVIs; then, clustering and characterization of the different units of analysis is performed using a model that connects the variables refined. The paper concludes with an exercise of innovation analysis applied to industrial groups in Colombia, using IVIs constructed with data from the first two national innovation surveys. © 2011 IEEE.It is widely acknowledged that disaster risk reduction is a development issue best addressed locally with community involvement, as an integral part of local development. Yet there are many constraints and realities that complicate the attainment of this ideal. This paper reviews the experience in disaster risk reduction in a range of cities, including Manizales, Colombia, which has integrated risk reduction into its development plan and its urban environmental management. The city government has also established an insurance programme for buildings that provides coverage for low-income households. The paper further describes and discusses the experiences of other city governments, including those of Santa Fe in Argentina and Medellín in Colombia. It emphasizes how, in order to be effective, disaster risk reduction has to be driven locally and must include the involvement of communities at risk as well as local governments. It also has to be integrated into development and land use management. But the paper emphasizes how these key local processes need support from higher levels of government and, very often, inter-municipal cooperation. Political or administrative boundaries seldom coincide with the areas where risk reduction needs to be planned and implemented.

The dynamics of educational processes, forms the backbone for the construction methodology that would serve as a model for mass deployment of educational innovation \"One by One.\".This study was made within the framework of characterizing the petrochemical and plastic sector and aims to analyze different models of organizational management for innovation. The methodology used was that of multiple explicative cases, taking the petrochemical-plastic cluster in Cartagena de Indias as the analysis unit. Conclusions reveal that the businesses studied do not have defined models for managing innovation, but are still based on quality management and a customer service system.This paper describes an experience of research, development and innovation applied in Industrial Naval at (Science and Technology Corporation for the Development of Shipbuilding Industry, Naval in Colombia (COTECMAR) particularly through processes of research, innovation and technological development, based on theoretical models related to organizational knowledge management, technology management and management of human talent and integration of technology platforms. It seeks ways to facilitate the initial establishment of environments rich in information, knowledge and content-supported collaborative strategies on dynamic processes missionary, seeking further development in the context of research, development and innovation of the Naval Engineering in Colombia, making it a distinct basis for the generation of knowledge assets from COTECMAR. The integration of information and communication technologies, supported on emerging technologies (mobile technologies, wireless, digital content via PDA, and content delivery services on the Web 2.0 and Web 3.0) as a view of the strategic thrusts in any organization facilitates the redefinition of processes for managing information and knowledge, enabling the redesign of workflows, the adaptation of new forms of organization - preferably in networking and support the creation of symbolic-inside-knowledge promotes the development of new skills, knowledge and attitudes of the knowledge worker.Spatial distribution of sand bodies with the capacity of storing hydrocarbons follows complex patterns in reservoirs deposited in fluvial environments. Understanding this distribution is one of the most important factors to consider in the planning and management of any development strategy. Usually, a vertical distribution of the sand bodies is obtained from well logs, core description, and outcrops added with sedimentation and depositional modeling using different techniques. This information is transferred to 2D and 3D stratigraphic models in correlations and stratigraphic panels. Despite of model depuration and tuning with development information, uncertainty is still very high. The acquisition of 3D multi-component seismic information was defined as the tool to reduce this uncertainty in the volumetric distribution of sand bodies and their connectivity, to build the geometry of the reflectors with the wave field P, identifying the lithology and the presence of fluids. A pilot of this technology was designed in the Tenerife field (Middle Magdalena Valley Basin, Colombia) focused in obtaining information of the Mugrosa formation, of Oligocene age, composed basically by sandstone deposited in thin fluvial channels, primarily meandering. To obtain the planned outcome, a high density design (480,000 traces / km2) was developed to allow a sufficient relation signal/noise in the S wave. Non conventional field tests allowed the design of the parameters of charge from the energy source and the depth of the receptors. For the static solutions, multi-component \"upholes\" and the description of the shot point (SP) where tested to allow a geological model of the strata that could be related with the velocities of the P wave and S wave. The innovative design for the management of the combination of seismic attributes of the S wave and P wave has shown considerable advantages in the definition of the sand bodies in fluvial environments as heterogeneous as this case. This innovation opens immense possibilities for the development of similar fields in the Middle Magdalena Valley Basin as in other regions of the world with similar deposits.

This topic has been approached due to the growing importance of change, especially profound change implying transformation regarding companies\\' central aspects, such as innovation, performance, competitiveness and organisational culture.The Sistema Nacional de Ciencia, Tecnología e Innovación de Colombia -SNCTeI- (Colombia\\'s National System of Science, Technology and Innovation), as an element of its managment strategies, is in the process of incorporating a new model of innovation called «triple helix», that tends to transform the traditional formation and investigation oriented University of into a business oriented university. This paper essays an approach to the impact that the strategies of the model of science, technology and innovation on the research activity in humanistic and social areas, in the frame of knowledge management. It will begin by taking into account critical theory and its conception of instrumental rationality, which will allow to show the problems that this kind of rationality poses to research in human and social sciences. The methodology of this research is qualitative and exploratory, developed through interviews directed to researchers in this area of knowledge, responsible for administration and management, to those who design the policies of public and private universities, and to governmental organizations. These interviews pretend to show their appreciations on the impact that these new policies and management strategies will have on human and social sciences. One of the conclusions of these study is that the new model of innovation, called triple helix, pretends that universities lead initiatives and finance the creation of technology based companies. This causes the researchers in human and social sciences to try to adapt themselves to the parameters set by this model, which leads to a blurring of their objects of study, and to the risk that the research on their area is limited to the narrow margins allowed by the commercialization of its results. © 2009 Escuela Interamericana de Bibliotecologia.

This study is based on a survey addressing multiple aspects of production in this industry (inputs, integration of activities, administrative management, innovation, exports, etc). Our results suggest that a reasonable percentage of total variance is accounted for by the variance of the inefficiency term. Additionally, the sample exhibits diminishing returns to labor. Even though many firms seem to be efficient, the leather sector as a whole is not operating near its production possibilities frontier. © 2009 Universidad de Antioquia.

However, universities must promote ethical values, respectting and defending their countries\\' ecological and cultural heritage when intellectual property rights are being promoted. A model for managing universities\\' industrial property rights is thus proposed here; it is centred on patents so as to improve strategies contributing towards Latin-American universities\\' scientific and technological development and thereby contribute towards their countries\\' development. The model is one of the relevant results derived from the theoretical framework for research carried out by the team from 2003-2007 and from the empirical study carried out in two phases. The first phase consisted of a survey whose objective was to detect critical aspects regarding managing patents and licenses for universities in Colombia, Chile and Spain. The second empirical phase consisted of holding in-depth interviews with those managing the patents for the universities having the best performance in the three aforementioned countries. © 2010.This work presents a conceptual proposal about the genesis and management of sectorial technology chains and their application in the development of new products. The proposal is based on the identification of knowledge and convergent technologies within the process of innovation technology, considering the study of existing products and processes and the analysis of technological and marketing trends. We report on a case-study based research carried out in Colombia on biopolymer chitin and chitosan applications. We also present a set of criteria for the integral evaluation of ideas and product concepts with potential for developing technological innovation. © 2007 PICMET.Colombia is the second largest world flower exporter. This leadership was achieved in part by the adaptation of imported technology. However, the special conditions of the production areas particular to the high tropics and increased international pressure require that the producers combine their efforts to increase productivity and competitiveness. To meet this challenge, the Colombian Association of Flower Exporters (Asocolflores) recently established the Colombian Centre for Innovation in Floriculture (Ceniflores) as a scientific, technological, independent, private, and non-profit institution. Research investment is long term and has proven high rates of return in other commodities. Due to limited funding, the flower sector needs adequate tools to manage it strategically. A research plan based on grower demand is the starting point for the Centre, which acts as \"virtual\" articulator between producers and research institutions, nationally and abroad. To achieve its objectives, Ceniflores has acquired a systems infrastructure built completely on Internet through a WEB-based architecture. This allows for information collection from multiple sources, its integration, and analysis. The information is available to different stakeholders through articulated networks (Business Web [B-Web]) built around the services offered, including access to documents, projects, research priority questionnaires, databases, and topic-based research networks, among others. The technology used is based on various open source applications, dramatically reducing time and cost to implement each of the services. Furthermore, the use of existing applications and how they have been integrated, allow replication of the model by other centres that require the creation of WEB based networks.Based on the Model of Management of Technology (GT) for Information Units (UI) of the Universities of Medell n, the authors have selected and adapted a GT model that integrates the settings in which the academic IU operates in terms of its administrative tasks and its strategic and operational planning, specifying the components of each and the GT tools that make their interaction possible, in addition to measuring and controlling its development and applications to the various processes of the UI. This article presents a condensed report of this research project, in particular the results of the diagnostics of the UI belonging to institutions of higher education in Medell n, Colombia, the relation between the diagnostics and the model, the critical factors that may be obstacles for the GT in a UI. It also serves as a proposal for a system of management indicators for the GT processes. © 2005 Escuela Interamericana de Bibliotecologia.

Methods An evaluative study was carried out, comparing the situation before and following the 1993 reform; model design was also compared. Control programme is understood as being the institution, the human group and administration in charge of control activities. The study was carried out in 2002 and 2003, in the Departments along the Colombian Pacific Coast; the four departmental capitals, 28 malarial and 5 control municipalities were included primary and secondary information was obtained by means of surveys and semi-structured interviews, community meetings and reviewing documentation in the secretariats of health, the Vector-borne disease control programme-VBDC, the Expanded Immunisation Programme-EIP, Health Promoting Entities-HPE, Subsidised Regime Administrators-SRA and Service-Providing Entities-SPE. Results The following results were obtained: 1. Illustrating and analysing malarial tendencies in the country and on the Pacific Coast, and the corresponding institutional transformations in the programme; 2. Characterising the control programme which existed before 1993; 3. Characterising departmental modes of decentralising the programme; 4. Identifying the effects of reforming the system and characterising control programme problems; 5. Comparing the programme with the Expanded Immunisation Programme (EIP); 6. Comparative analysis of the programme and identifying current gaps in management capability; 7. Actors\\' perceptions regarding the control programme; 8. Values and challenges for an innovative control programme; and 9. Designing a model for up-dating/adapting the control programme. Discussion Malaria control programmes\\' problems and weaknesses are frequently and inarticulately attributed to the lack of knowledge and management skill of personnel working in such programmes, the lack of an information and communication system or weaknesses in the municipalities or personnel. These factors may well have had an effect; however, a global and institutional approach leads to locating the programmes within a social, political and cultural context. This allows interpreting control programmes\\' current problems, amidst decentralisation and reform processes, and linking this interpretation to modelling and opening a space for innovation in such programmes. The study\\'s main limitations spring from particularities regarding Pacific Coast control programmes and weakness in health information systems.Colombia is a poor country that has been plagued by ongoing violence for more than 120 years. During the 1940s, subversive terrorist groups emerged in rural areas of the country when criminal groups came under the influence of Communism, and were later transformed into contemporary groups, such as the Ejercito de Liberacion Nacional (ELN) or National Liberation Army and Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionares de Colombia (FARC) or Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia). Paramilitary terrorist groups emerged in response to subversive groups and were later transformed into contemporary groups, such as the Autodefensas Unidas de Colombia (AUC) or United Self-Defense Forces of Colombia. Terrorism has placed an enormous burden on modern Colombia. From 1995 to 2002, 9,435 people were killed by terrorism-related events, of which 5,864 were killed by subversive terrorist activities and 3,571 were killed by paramilitary terrorist activities. In 2002, at least nineteen attacks produced 10 or more casualties, of which 18 were bombings. In 2002, terrorists killed at least 12 mayors, 71 legislators, and internally displaced 300,000 persons from their homes. Since terrorist groups in Colombia are typically supported by drug manufacturing and trafficking, it has been difficult at times to distinguish violence due to terrorism from violence due to illicit drug trafficking. Terrorism has also had a major adverse effect on the economy, with restricted travel, loss of economic resources, and lack of economic investment. In addition to political, military, and commercial targets, terrorists have specifically targeted healthcare infrastructure and personnel. At the national and local levels, much emergency planning and preparedness has taken place for terrorism-related events. The Centro Regulador de Urgencias (CRU) or Emergency Regulation Center in Bogota plays a major role in coordinating local prehospital and hospital emergency response in the capital city and the national level where necessary. © World Association for Disaster and Emergency Medicine 2003.This paper describes the development of Bioplan-Manizales. a local environmental action plan (LEAP) for the city of Manizales, and the different groups that contributed to its development: also, how this plan became integrated into the municipal development plan and the municipal budget. The measures taken to monitor and evaluate the social, economic and environmental effects of the environmental policy are also described and these include a series of urban environmental observatories. The paper also describes the broader national and international context for the innovations in Manizales - including the political, legislative and fiscal changes in Colombia that have encouraged local authorities to develop local environmental agendas. Manizales\\' own historical development is described including the environmental changes that this development brought and the environmental problems that it precipitated.This article analyzes policy innovation in Colombia, through the adoption of a new centralized oil-rent management system in 2011, after 20 years of decentralized policies. Using a policy-design framework, we identify a causal mechanism linking the opening of a policy window to policy change as a combination of the emergence of a new policy network, the adoption of a new policy paradigm and the selection of a new instruments mix. Drawing on Bayesian statistics, the 11 tests conducted on the causal mechanism show the importance of State resources of information, authority, treasury and organization to assess the outcome of policy change.Little literature has looked at the role of universities promoting and supporting grassroots social innovations. This paper addresses this gap by examining how universities contribute to social innovation in Colombia. In seeking to develop a good understanding of how universities can contribute to the development of social innovation niches, we draw upon the Strategic Niche Management theory and the three areas of activity which constitute effective niche-building: social networks, expectations and visions and learning. We explore this phenomenon with the Parque Científico de Innovación Social, founded by Uniminuto University in 2012, using video case study research methodology. Findings suggest the important role played by Uniminuto University influencing the current higher education system regime by enhancing the development of social innovation niches. These results have implications for advancing the debate on the role of higher education institutions in contributing to the development of social innovation processes.Poca literatura ha analizado el papel de las universidades promoviendo y apoyando las innovaciones sociales de base. Este documento aborda esta brecha al examinar cómo las universidades contribuyen a la innovación social en Colombia. Al tratar de desarrollar una buena comprensión de cómo las universidades pueden contribuir al desarrollo de nichos de innovación social, recurrimos a la teoría de Gestión Estratégica de Nichos y las tres áreas de actividad que constituyen la creación efectiva de nichos: redes sociales, expectativas y visiones y aprendizaje. Exploramos este fenómeno con el Parque Científico de Innovación Social, fundado por la Universidad de Uniminuto en 2012, utilizando la metodología de investigación de estudios de casos de video. Los hallazgos sugieren el importante papel desempeñado por la Universidad de Uniminuto que influye en el régimen actual del sistema de educación superior al mejorar el desarrollo de nichos de innovación social. Estos resultados tienen implicaciones para avanzar en el debate sobre el papel de las instituciones de educación superior en la contribución al desarrollo de los procesos de innovación social.The services sector has been constituted as the most important of the national economy with a 51.1% of GDP share in 2014, however, in that same year, represented less than 0.2% in the country\\'s exports. In this sense, the objective of this article is to identify the relationship between innovation and internationalization in the services sector in Colombia in order to understand their low participation in exports. Thus, a reference framework on the services sector is presented and a quantitative descriptive analysis of the EDITS information is carried out. From this analysis, it is concluded that the number of companies with innovation activities has decreased, that the few results of these activities are not oriented to the international markets and that they are financed almost entirely by the companies in the face of the low level of public support.ResumenEl sector servicios se ha constituido como el más importante de la economía nacional con una participación del 51.1% del PIB en el 2014, sin embargo, en ese mismo año, representó menos del 0.2% en las exportaciones del país. En ese sentido, el objetivo de este artículo es identificar la relación entre innovación e internacionalización en el sector servicios en Colombia con el fin de comprender su baja participación en las exportaciones. Así, se presenta un marco de referencia sobre el sector servicios y se realiza un análisis cuantitativo descriptivo de la información de la EDITS. De este análisis se concluye que el número de empresas con actividades de innovación ha decrecido, que los pocos resultados de estas actividades no se orientan a los mercados internacionales y que son financiadas casi en su totalidad por las empresas ante el bajo nivel de apoyo público.ResumoO setor de serviços tornou-se o mais importante da economia nacional com uma quota de 51,1% do PIB em 2014, no entanto, nesse ano, representava menos de 0,2% nas exportações. Nesse sentido, o objetivo deste artigo é identificar a relação entre inovação e internacionalização do setor de serviços na Colômbia a fim de compreender a sua baixa participação nas exportações. Assim, um quadro para o setor de serviços é apresentado e uma análise quantitativa descritiva das informações edições é realizada. Esta análise concluiu que o número de empresas com atividades de inovação diminuiu, os poucos resultados destas atividades não são destinados a mercados internacionais e são financiados quase inteiramente pelas empresas com o baixo nível de apoio público.Projetos de inovação podem desenhar, desenvolver e implementar uma abordagem prática e estruturada, com o objetivo de criar um modelo gerencial de inovação. As deficiências nas habilidades de gerenciamento de pequenas empresas (em gestão econômica, financeira ou humana) ou as limitações de recursos não são uma questão de inovação nem o setor o a indústria da empresa. É a falta de processos estruturados que integram inovação de produtos, serviços, processos, marketing e modelos de negócios e, ao mesmo tempo, criam os recursos que capacitam os líderes de negócios a agirem sobre inovação. Os programas de inovação praticados em pequenas empresas enfatizaram o como fazê-lo em duas experiências no Peru e na Colombia. A inovação de produtos e serviços foi baseada em metodologias em quatro eixos; contexto empresarial, aprendizado por imersão, gamificação, lean e design thinking. Embora a inovação do modelo de negócios baseada nos mesmos processos e metodologias exigisse recursos e ferramentas adicionais. Isso pode envolver estrutura de modelos de inovação, ferramentas de desenho de modelos de negócios, rede de valor de parceria, todos focados no contexto de negócios (tendências e tecnologias), usuários como co-criadores de valor, plataformas digitais e ecossistemas.The purpose of this reflection article is to analyze education management, as an important component of education, and more exactly, its fundamental role on teacher formation at the university; management optimizes all processes of the university. In this manner, the first thing is to define what management is, then what education management is, and, end with an analysis of such management at the university. This distribution allows to start from the general concept, and in this manner understand the particular, which leads to conclude that it is necessary a significant relationship between management and teacher formation.The need for small and medium-sized enterprises to innovate and their limited human resource management practices have led to growing research into how the organization’s internal staff-focused characteristics promote a higher degree of innovation. Faced with scarce literature about this relationship in smaller companies in Colombia and the ever-present need to be competitive, this research aims to identify the effect of human resource management practices on innovation in Colombian SMEs. Four hundred and ninety-two surveys were applied to SME managers in Cali, Bogotá, and Medellín to meet such an objective. This research made it evident that human resource management practices affect innovation, but not all practices exert the same influence. Staff selection and performance evaluation affect product innovation, processes, and overall innovation, while compensation only influences product innovation. The other human resource management practices do not account for any kind of effect. This research contributes to prioritizing human resource management practices for innovation and the management thereof within small and medium-sized enterprises.Purpose To understand how innovation strategy measure by organizational methods and technology equipment, affects to organizational learning measure by improvement in production, distribution and logistics systems. MethodologyThis is an empirical analysis of the innovation strategy and organizational learning, concentrating on 8835 manufacturing companies in 33 subsectors with innovative processes, investment in research and development, better organizational methods and technology equipment, using databases from the National Department of Statistics-DANE. Multiple Regression. Software SPSS. Findings: An industry with an innovation strategy tends to get better and improved processes, and this learning allows firms to achieve value creation for the customer, turning into better types of products offered with unique characteristics to compete in the challenging markets. Where the greatest improvement in methods of production, distribution, delivery and logistics will be the result of a very well manage innovation, to more innovation strategy more organizational learning. Research Limitations:The type of innovations in process were heterogeneous and the data do not allow to clarify specific improvement and innovation type. Practical Implications:This empirical study establishes, two special practical implications, first identify special characteristics in innovation in one of the most representative sectors of the Colombian economy that even though address incremental innovations, especially through processes, and the second element is to recognize that the innovative strategy becomes a differentiating factor for companies in this sector, beyond technological barriers and culture of innovation that may appear. Originality:The research was made for the most innovative sectors in the manufacturing Colombian industry, this particular context was not studied enough before in the particular constructs of innovation strategy and organizational learning. Key Words: Innovation, manufacturing industry, strategy, organizational learning, processes.JEL: M1, M10El objetivo de la investigación fue la identificación de estrategias gerenciales del sector de las MiPyME de Santa Marta, Colombia. Se estudiaron bases teóricas de los autores Ohmae, Robert, David y Martínez. La metodología se basó en el paradigma de investigación positivista. Para la recolección de datos se elaboró un cuestionario, validado por expertos y aplicado a una población de 40 empleados, el cual arrojó como resultado la aplicación de estrategias de innovación ofensiva, defensiva, imitativa, dependiente, tradicional y oportunista o de nicho. Se concluye que el comportamiento gerencial refleja la preocupación por obtener un liderazgo técnico, no se asumen riesgos para la innovación, se busca ganar ventaja de errores de los demás, no comprar tecnología existente, vender sus productos sin cambiarlos, mejora de procesos operativos e identificar oportunidades en el mercado, demostrando total apoyo a la competencia regional.STRUCTURED ABSTRACT1)      Objective: The present research aims to identify how the innovative strategy affects the organizational performance and quality in processes of service sector organizations in Colombia, taking into account their production process improvements, and organizational methods. 2)      Method: It was used the Survey of Development and Technological Innovation (EDIT) created by the Administrative National Department of Statistics DANE, collecting 19 subsectors and a total of 5.848  companies. 3)      Theoretical Framework: This research is settled in the competitive strategy, resource based view of the firm, and innovation theory. 4)      Results: Finding that the innovative strategy benefits the improvement in the quality of processes and this in turn becomes the engine of organizational performance. 5)      Conclusions: The Colombian services sector represents an important sector for economic growth, the innovative strategy becomes the determining factor to create value in the processes and offer quality services that promote sector organizations as the best in each area. However, for the smaller organizations in each service sector, higher levels of investment are required that allow them to make improvements in production methods and continuous organizational methods; investment in scientific, technological and innovation activities must have all sources of financing that translate into substantial changes in services. 6)      Contributions: This research allows to understand for the service sector and their particular context the importance to have an innovation strategy with scarce resources to improve performance and quality. The innovation strategy affects both cases, the organizational performance is better in the organizations of the service sector, which means that their sales levels increase every time they generate substantial improvements in methods of providing services, distribution, delivery or logistic system, which we have called production methods, and second, in the quality of processes of these companies, improving routines within the organization, internal improvements called improvements in organizational methods are generated improvements in the quality of each process, this effect for organizations is translated into certifications that impact on the final customer who acquires the service.Key Words: Innovation Strategy, Innovation, Organizational Performance, Service Industry, Quality Management.JEL: M1, M10, L8 REGULAR ABSTRACT: The present research aims to identify how the innovative strategy affects the organizational performance and quality in processes of service sector organizations in Colombia, taking into account their production process improvements, and organizational methods.

En la metodología, se examinan los datos de la cuarta encuesta de innovación tecnológica colombiana EDIT IV, mediante un análisis de correspondencias múltiples. En cuanto a los resultados, se identificaron tres grupos o clúster, con características comunes: el primero es el grupo de las pymes innovadoras, que se distingue por tener un desempeño innovador destacado; el segundo, las empresas seguidoras/ principiantes, que se muestran en un punto intermedio y el tercero comprende las rezagadas, que muestran resultados bajos en todos los frentes y al cual pertenecen el mayor número de empresas del país.Corruption, financial disequilibrium, unemployment, inflation, among other factors, have been the cause of the general crisis in today’s society, they have produced a time lag for the economic, educational and social development of Latin American countries. Colombia is not the exception to this set of problems, on the contrary, it is a country that today has been hit by economic and financial difficulties, corruptive acts at a national governmental level, drug trafficking, and a series of conflicts that have brought instability to the productive system of the country, therefore affecting growth in as much as competitiveness, innovation and technology. Facing these problems from the national government point of view, it is necessary to shape some educative policies at a higher educational level. The Higher Educational Institutions, including technical and technological must make reforms to their institutional structures, adapting them to market demands. That is why, inside general parameters, the education of teachers must be included as a main cross sectional axis for student’s learning.El Sector Defensa es un sector basado en tecnología, en la medida en que requiere de procesos de desarrollo, adquisición y aprovechamiento de activos tecnológicos para el logro de sus objetivos misionales, orientados a garantizar la soberanía nacional y la seguridad ciudadana. Se trata de un sector estratégico que, principalmente en países en desarrollo, depende en gran medida de actividades de transferencia tecnológica, y en el cual es clave el concepto de tecnología dual (referido a la posibilidad de implementarse tanto en aplicaciones militares como civiles). Esta ponencia tiene como objetivo analizar la Gestión de la tecnología y la innovación en este sector. Para ello, inicialmente se hizo un estudio sobre las particularidades del Sector Defensa en el ámbito internacional, con énfasis en el caso colombiano.El objetivo principal de este artículo es describir los aspectos más relevantes de las relaciones de cooperación en innovación entre empresas pertenecientes al Programa de Asociatividad y Desarrollo Empresarial Sectorial -PADES- de la Asociación Colombiana de Micro, Pequeñas y Medianas Empresas -ACOPI- en el departamento de Antioquia (Colombia). La investigación es de carácter exploratorio, se indagó fundamentalmente la opinión de gerentes / personal de la alta dirección y se utilizó el análisis descriptivo para establecer frecuencias en materia de actividades y resultados de innovación; agentes, motivos, obstáculos para la cooperación en innovación y fuentes de financiación. Los resultados muestran que las empresas, cooperan mayoritariamente con empresas del PADES, realizan innovaciones blandas, poco intensivas en conocimiento, sobre todo en materia organizacional y en marketing, financiadas mayormente con recursos propios. Además, que la falta de confianza y de cultura son sus mayores obstáculos para la cooperación en innovación.Este artículo presenta las particularidades del modelo de gestión del Parque Científico de Innovación Social (PCIS), describiendo las características en cuanto su acción como agente del ecosistema de innovación enmarcado por la enorme complejidad que el concepto de innovación social imprime a cada uno de sus frentes de acción. Explica cómo la transformación de las comunidades se convierte en el eje articulador de su modelo de gestión, bien sea desde la identificación de nuevas respuestas, procesos, competencias y formas de participación para la solución de problemas sociales, desde la promoción de nuevas y más eficientes estrategias de gobernanza a partir de la interacción con diversidad de actores locales y global desde la gestión del conocimiento entendida como el “aprendizaje colectivo”. Introduction. The steady dynamics of science, technology and innovation plus the volume of information that these subjects have, represent a challenge to the research groups endeavor and to the commitment of the later ones to be knowledge developing units that give significant outputs to its social and academic settings. Therefore, there must be a planning alternative that supports the decisionmaking processes in order to give it a better knowledge founding, to reduce the possible risks and to think ahead the possible changes. This alternative must be supportedby an organized, selective and systematic procedure, such as the technological surveillance. Objective. To create a descriptive literature review regarding technological surveillance and a proposal for the technological surveillance method applied to the management of scientific activity of the Estudio Genetico de Enfermedades Complejas (EGEC – Genetic Study for Complex Diseases) research group. Methodology. Descriptive literature review. The following academic databases were consulted: Medline, SciELO, Ebsco e IEEE and Google Scholar search engine. The combination of keywords used when consulting the academic databases, was “vigilancia tecnológica/technological surveillance”, “salud/health”, “enfermedad/disease”, “ejemplos en salud”, “universidad” and “investigación”. Articles of the last five years are included, while articles that only had to deal with the results dissemination of technological surveillance exercises, were excluded. Based on the literature review analysis of results, a technological surveillance model is proposed which its objective is to manage the EGEC research group’s scientific activities. In order to do so, a stages, inputs and funds diagrams that integrated the surveillance model, were created. Thus, the already mentioned diagrams included a cancer pilot test as a validation strategy, and with the test results, the model was subjected to additional adjustments.Results. The Spanish standard UNE 166006:2011 created by the Spanish Association for Standarization and Certification (AENOR), was taken as an international reference whilst the program España y sus Regiones Intercambian Conocimiento con Antioquia (ERICA) and the methodology for technological surveillance Innovaciones a partir de la Vigilancia Tecnológica (InnoViTech), were taken as national referents. Additionally, conceptual stages, good practices for processes execution and defined budget for the development of technological surveillance, are established. The main components for the proposed model include needs identification, plus the planning, collection, auditing, analysis, documentation, and information spreading processes. Conclusions. The proposed model works as a foundation for developing a knowledge management strategy of a research group. Also, the model highlights the importance of climbing towards the usage of competitive intelligence systems within itself. [CarrilloZambrano E, Páez-Leal MC, Suárez JM, Luna-González ML.

MedUNAB. 2018;21(1):84-99. doi: 10.29375/01237047.2746].This document aims to analize the influence of the management of the technology in the industrial production, which has provoked radical changes in the use of the production factors; the hand labor, for instance, its is being changed by technological know ledge and the stock which generate significant increments on the productivity indicators.  Each time competitiveness, centers more its relevance in the innovation, as element of change and transformation it has allowed designing flexible production systems, nowadays they permit to obtain efficient processes without the practice of the economies of scale.  The technical, technological and university education must bring up a creative professional, who must be worried about the design, organization, technological systems management according to our reality, it is processes, where the alliances and projects be fruit of the dynamic reactivation in the dynamic reactivation in the relation enterprise University-Government. El objetivo fundamental de esta investigación fue identificar las habilidades gerenciales para una cultura de innovación universitaria en instituciones de Colombia y Venezuela. Para cumplir con el objetivo, se estudiaron las bases teóricas de los autores Horth y Buchner (2009), Dyer, Gregersen y Christensen (2012) y Thomas (2010), entre otros. La metodología utilizada fue bajo el paradigma de investigación positivista y la investigación fue descriptiva con un diseño no experimental, transeccional y de campo. La población estuvo constituida por 60 docentes de cada universidad. Como instrumento para la recolección de datos se elaboró un cuestionario utilizando las categorías de respuestas de tipo Likert de 33 ítems, validado por siete expertos en el área. La confiabilidad del instrumento fue determinada por el método Alfa de Cronbach y presentó un 0,94 de confiabilidad. Los resultados de la investigación permiten evidenciar un bajo porcentaje tanto en las habilidades necesarias para ser innovadores, como en las habilidades de descubrimiento, por lo que se concluye la ausencia de las habilidades gerencialespara una cultura de innovación universitaria en instituciones de educación superior de Colombia y Venezuela.Un aspecto que permite reconocer el fomento a la innovación en un país se corresponde con la cantidad de patentes solicitadas y otorgadas por este. Entendiendo que, de esta manera, se puede reconocer la dinámica en que el conocimiento se genera y apropia con fines industriales y comerciales. En este contexto, se busca establecer un panorama tecnológico colombiano, basado en las patentes presentadas entre los años 2000 a 2018, según los titulares asociados, así como su origen y naturaleza como persona natural o jurídica (empresas o universidades). Como resultado de este ejercicio se ratifica la percepción generalizada de que en el país se protegen principalmente desarrollos asociados con el sector farmacéutico, encontrando que esto se presenta para el caso de titulares no residentes en el país; mientras que para los residentes el mayor interés se genera por parte de personas naturales sin una especialidad técnica concreta. Por otro lado, se encuentra que las patentes no necesariamente representan un factor de competitividad en el mercado, sino un factor de estatus o distinción para el caso de los nacionales y una herramienta de protección de mercado para los extranjeros. Esto último dado que los objetos de protección por patente en su gran mayoría no se fabrican en el país sino que solo se comercializan.ResumenFue aplicada la metodología del Radar de la Innovación (Innoradar). Los resultados de este análisis indican que todavía hay un largo camino por recorrer para que las empresas, sin importar su tamaño, incorporen conceptos modernos asociados con la investigación, desarrollo tecnológico y la innovación (IDT+I). También se recalca la importancia y el significado de adoptar la gestión estratégica de la tecnología y la innovación como parte de su estrategia corporativa. El objetivo del presente estudio es analizar la calidad de servicios ofrecida por el Centro Cardiovascular del Magdalena- Colombia, para optimizar la atención prestada a sus usuarios. Se fundamenta en un enfoque positivista, con un diseño de investigación no experimental, de campo, transversal; y un tipo de estudio descriptivo, bajo la modalidad de estudio de caso. La población está conformada por dicho centro, el cual recibe un promedio de 550 personas (usuarios) por mes cuenta con 35 trabajadores, los informantes clave fueron 210 usuarios de los servicios quienes decidieron participar de forma voluntaria y 20 trabajadores, para un total de 230. La técnica empleada fue la encuesta a través de un cuestionario. Los resultados evidencian una tendencia alta a considerar profundamente la calidad del servicio; integrando mayor tecnología en la comunicación y mejorando sustancialmente los servicios de atención, así como también conocer las necesidades específicas del cliente. Los usuarios y acompañantes manifestaron que el centro de diagnóstico cuenta con mediana tecnología. Se concluye que en el Centro Cardiovascular la prestación del servicio según la percepción de usuarios y acompañantes es de excelente calidad, sin embargo, puede mejorar en la medida en que se incorporen elementos innovadores en el servicio.'"
