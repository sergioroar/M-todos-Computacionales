Innovation capabilities measurement using fuzzy methodologies: a Colombian SMEs case,Computational and Mathematical Organization Theory,"The main aim of this paper is to establish the hidden incidences that can improve specific aspects of beekeeper Small and Medium Enterprises (SME) innovation capabilities in Boyacá-Colombia. The methodology is focused on the use of the expertons model, adequacy coefficient and forgotten effects theory. A questionnaire of 58 items about different innovation management areas is distributed to 14 beekeeper SMEs in the area of Boyacá-Colombia. The findings suggest that there are two specific actions that can improve innovation culture. These actions are related to marketing strategies and product innovation. The innovation strategy has a significant influence on the development of an innovative culture in the beekeeper SMEs; one must have a clear orientation to the innovation objectives in the marketing strategy, which is transferred to the product. Likewise, the utility of fuzzy methods for analysis when information is limited, subjective and scarce is highlighted. Finally, this research can be useful to practitioners and academics because the findings can serve as guidelines to understanding sources and enablers of innovation. In addition, the findings show how fuzzy methods help in contending with incomplete and subjective information, highlighting the meaning of the information rather than its measurement. © 2021, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",2021
Economic and social impact of cooperatives with financial activity: Analysis from their determining attributes in two Colombian cities [Incidencia económica y social de las cooperativas con actividad financiera: Análisis desde sus atributos determinantes],Revista Venezolana de Gerencia,"Cooperatives with financial activity stimulate the economy by providing economic resources to individuals and companies that cannot access the banking sector or prefer to belong to the cooperative sector. The objective is to analyze the economic and social impact of these cooperatives in the cities of Montería and Ibagué, Colombia, considering their determining attributes. The study is descriptive with a quantitative approach and 32 financial cooperatives participated. A questionnaire validated by expert judgment and a Cronbach’s Alpha coefficient of 0.815. The results show that the type of user, contracting modality, product offering, surplus growth, investments and advertising strategies, are some of the determining attributes in the management of the cooperatives with financial activity. It is concluded that these entities have an economic and social impact that is reflected in the quality of life of their associates, their families and their environment. Investing in technology and innovation is recommended to meet current and future challenges facing the cooperative sector. © 2021, Universidad del Zulia. All rights reserved.",2021
Seeding resilient restoration: An indicator system for the analysis of tree seed systems,Diversity,"Achieving multi-million-hectare commitments from countries around the world to restore degraded lands in resilient and sustainable ways requires, among other things, huge volumes of tree planting material. Seed systems encompassing all forest reproductive material (e.g., seeds, cuttings, stakes, and wildings), are key to ensuring that sufficient planting material with a diverse range of suitable species, adapted to local conditions and capable of persisting under a changing climate, is available for restoration projects. The ideal structure of a seed system integrates five components: seed selection and innovation, seed harvesting and production, market access, supply and demand, quality control, and an enabling environment. We propose 15 indicators to evaluate these key components and trial them by assessing national seed systems in 7 Latin American countries. We conclude that the indicators enable a straightforward assessment of the strengths and weaknesses of national seed systems, thus assisting governments to identify key areas for improvement and opportunities for horizontal learning. © 2021 by the authors.

"Science, technology, innovation, theory and evidence: the new institutionality in Colombia",Quality and Quantity,"It is widely recognized that the design and application of suitable and robust science, technology and innovation (STI) policies and appropriate STI institutions promote development, economic growth and competitiveness in the long run. This paper analyses the dynamics of STI in Colombia over the 1995–2019 period to determine its relationship with its most important determinants and its collateral relationship with economic growth as an input affecting different issues; this work takes into account the creation of the new ministry of science, technology and innovation (MSTI) and uses different time series techniques. According to the analysis, a positive relationship exists between investments in research and development, STI activities, and the independence and transparency of STI management by the new MSTI, which could generate higher productivity, technological change, economic growth and development. The results of the models also demonstrate the long-run relationship and short-run dynamics related to STI investment and research results and the importance of transparency and independence. It is important to establish adequate STI governance and allow new ministries to play an important role to achieve a society based on knowledge that produces relevant research, technology and innovation based on the needs and resources of the country. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.",2021

"National Network for Knowledge Management, Research, and Innovation in Tuberculosis in Colombia [Rede Nacional de Gestão do Conhecimento, Pesquisa e Inovação em tuberculose na Colômbia] [Red Nacional de Gestión de Conocimiento, Investigación e Innovación en Tuberculosis en Colombia]",Revista Panamericana de Salud Publica/Pan American Journal of Public Health,"In 2018, the Colombian Ministry of Health and Social Protection, in collaboration with the National Health Institute and the Pan American Health Organization, convened all actors associated with the National Tuberculosis Prevention and Control Program (PNPCT) and the National Science, Technology, and Innovation System to form a national network to coordinate operations research on tuberculosis (TB) in the country. Seven workshops were held and a consensus was reached to establish the National Network for Knowledge Management, Research, and Innovation in Tuberculosis in Colombia (TB Colombia Network). With more than 180 participants, a central node, and five regional nodes that bring together the country's 37 territorial entities, the TB Colombia Network conducted four days of training in operations research in 2019, defining 65 priority research topics aligned with the strategic lines in the PNPCT: prevention and comprehensive care, with a focus on people affected by TB (41 topics in three modules); and political commitment, social protection, and support systems (24 topics in four modules). The peer comparison method was used for prioritization. The TB Colombia Network remains active and contributes to knowledge management aimed at eliminating TB in Colombia. It has helped make progress in building plans and implementing local operations research projects that generate scientifically validated results to strengthen the PNPCT and improve the care of TB patients. © 2021 Pan American Health Organization.

Design of an integrated quality management system for Colombian higher education academic programs,Formacion Universitaria,"In this research study an integrated quality management system is proposed for academic programs in Colombian higher education by considering the Colombian legal requirements and high quality accreditation guidelines, and the ISO 9001 standard. Concepts associated with high quality assurance, quality management, and excellence models in higher education were used as theoretical frameworks. There were three standards used: the Colombia decree 1330 of 2019, the ISO 9001 standard, and the Colombian Agreement 1 of 2020, which establishes the accreditation factors for higher education in Colombia. The results compared their characteristics and requirements. This allowed defining common processes and factors that guarantee the basic structure of an integrated quality management system while generating value for education programs. It is concluded that the ISO 9001 standard provides process management, innovation, and knowledge management. © 2021. All Rights Reserved.",2021
"Methodology for the Governance and Management of the University as a Complex Adaptive System Based on the Three Missions: Research, Education, and Connecting with Its Surroundings","Palgrave Studies in Democracy, Innovation and Entrepreneurship for Growth","Scientific capabilities are a concept subordinated to the productivity metrics of classical scientometrics. This has generated a series of management and evaluation processes of university scientific activity that constrain the understanding of the capacities generated by the institutions themselves. Even in the application of their instruments and policy models, productivity plateaus are achieved that raise questions about the possibility of sustainability and governance of these capacities. The chapter proposes a redefinition of the notion of science, technology, and innovation (STI) capabilities that go beyond the comparison of the relative competitive weight or value of one group with respect to another, but rather in terms of the heterogeneity between types of scientific and technological activity that universities carry out. For this purpose, we conceptualize the university as a complex adaptive system (CAS) in order to propose a methodology for evaluating the expected or planned results in the three missions—training, research, and extension—, in terms of the activation of governance mechanisms. In this context, this chapter focuses, exemplifies, and learns from the analysis and experience of modeling the STI capabilities of the Universidad del Valle de Colombia, through which we offer an alternative to strengthening the governance and management of the university mission. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",2021
Community-Based Innovation Ecosystems in Peace-Building and Resilience Contexts,"Palgrave Studies in Democracy, Innovation and Entrepreneurship for Growth","This chapter proposes the concept of Community-Based Innovation Ecosystem, as a framework for analysing communal and transformative innovation processes, particularly in territories affected by armed and social conflicts. In this way, it questions the conventional notion of innovation as a transactional process to open new markets in capitalism, towards a re-signified notion, as a sociotechnical process of collective transformation linked to actions carried out by grassroots organizations and communities. Therefore, the ecology of innovation is used as a biological metaphor for the studies of management and innovation. The case of the Guajuí River Community Council in Guapi—Colombia is described and analysed through the relationships between diverse, historically excluded actors through collaboration in post-conflict or post-agreement contexts. Finally, a series of conclusions are presented regarding the interdependent dynamics of the actors in Guapi, their limitations, opportunities, and future lines of action. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",2021
Exploring the enablers and microfoundations of international knowledge transfer,Journal of Knowledge Management,"Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to examine the enablers and barriers influencing international knowledge transfer at the team-level in the context of product innovation within an emerging-market multinational enterprise (EMNE) in the insurance industry. Design/methodology/approach: The research applies an exploratory case study design considering an emerging-market multinational insurance company headquartered in Colombia. Four subsidiaries (El Salvador, Chile, Argentina and Colombia) and the Corporate Office (headquarter) served as the research sites. It also adopts an interpretive research approach providing a grounded theory framework linking international knowledge transfer and product innovation. Findings: The empirical findings emphasize the central role played by the enablers (i.e. shared vision, empathy and knowledge sources) in facilitating international knowledge transfer, which, in turn, enhances product innovation. More important, however, is the detailed explanation that the paper provides regarding the enablers’ microfoundational antecedents in terms of key activities that are performed at the team-level. Research limitations/implications: The grounded theory framework was constructed using data collected in a single firm associated with a particular industry and regional context. The study only considered a single aspect of knowledge management (i.e. knowledge transfer). Other aspects of knowledge management systems, such as knowledge creation and knowledge application, should be used for explaining product innovation in EMNEs more comprehensively. Practical implications: The study suggests a set of enabling conditions and activities that should be adopted by managers of EMNEs to improve international knowledge transfer with the aim of triggering product innovation. This includes the design of strategies for strengthening empathy among geographically dispersed teams by providing opportunities for regular live videoconferences among team members aimed at building close bonds, fostering trust and creating a sense of belonging in which participants get to know each other better and to establish a shared vision and a set of guiding principles and commitments for how the team will work. These suggestions are particularly important today when several multinational enterprises (MNEs) have been forced to rearrange their workplace by replacing face-to-face interactions with virtual work dynamics due to the COVID-19 crisis. Originality/value: Previous studies have confirmed that international knowledge transfer positively influences MNEs’ innovative performance. However, no studies have been conducted linking both variables in the context of EMNEs in Latin America in the service sector. The research tries to fill this gap. Besides, the paper introduces empathy as a novel enabler for international knowledge transfer and a moderator able to diminish the negative effect that cultural differences and geographical barriers have on the knowledge transfer process. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.",2021
Application of the CERT Values Measurement Model for Organizational Culture in the Management and Quality Company,Communications in Computer and Information Science,"At present, it has been shown that very few SMEs have knowledge of the Business Process Management BPM system, which offers a series of strategies and benefits oriented towards processes, using technology systems in terms of information management, evaluating the organizational culture and covering all the operational and business processes of the organization, in order to increase productivity and competitiveness, guaranteeing continuous improvement of internal processes following their life cycle, where they are documented, analyzed, improved, are implemented, and are monitored and controlled. In this study, the BPM culture of an information technology SME, called Management and Quality, was evaluated based on the study carried out by Jan Vom Brocke, in which 4 values are established, which are: customer orientation, excellence, responsibility, and teamwork, called CERT values, the survey adapted to the context of the company and Colombia was applied; As a result, opportunities for improvement in excellence were found represented by the dimensions of continuous improvement and innovation, and in the formal structures, dimension of teamwork, recommendations were made for these findings. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",2021
Management Model and Dynamic Capabilities: Approaches to Knowledge-Intensive Business Services in Emerging Economies,Eurasian Studies in Business and Economics,"Countries with emerging economies such as Mexico, Argentina, Chile, and Colombia are lagging behind China, India, and others in Knowledge-Intensive Business Services (KIBS), due to their organizational inertia to sense and seize new market opportunities and achieve new and innovative ways of competitive advantage. The objective of this paper is to analyze the dynamic capabilities needed to enhance the management model in KIBS in emerging economies context. The study is carried out by gathering and reviewing successful experiences extracted from the literature on management models for KIBS in developed countries, leading emerging economies, and Latin American countries. As a result, the relevance of this type of service is established in some of the most developed economies, as well as the capabilities that have been strengthened in leading emerging countries, such as China and India, to finally propose the actions that Latin American countries can undertake. Main results show the need to embed absorptive cutting-edge knowledge capabilities in KIBS organizations, to consolidate, reinforce, and innovate in processes reflected in competitive services. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",2021
Grassroots innovation practices for social transformation of the health and well-being in a self-built settlement in Medellín-Colombia,Health and Social Care in the Community,"Grassroots innovation generates possibilities for the informal and collective production of the territory that the city itself denies, from bottom-up solutions for sustainable development and consumption, which respond to the local situation, interests, and values of the communities involved. This paper aims to identify how grassroots innovation practices take place and are shaped in ‘El Faro’, a self-built settlement at the urban border of the city of Medellín; and how these have allowed the social transformation of health and well-being. This was done from a qualitative approach with an interpretative scope, under the case study methodology. ‘El Faro’ is a space built by its inhabitants, in a process that they have called ""dignity and resistance"", becoming the promoter of what we identify as four ‘grassroots innovation practices’ developed around three main issues: community water management, artistic training and the creation of community public spaces. This process has allowed them, from the capacity of agency, to understand their poverty situation and face it, modifying the conditions that reproduce it and responding to unsatisfied basic needs, based on innovative solutions that guarantee conditions of life with dignity and well-being. Likewise, it generates mechanisms that reduce inequality because the community becomes the main driving agent for the construction of the city and the transformation of the health-disease process, through its community assets. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",2021
Democratic Production and Mobilization of Knowledge in Colombia,Communications in Computer and Information Science,"Knowledge is important to the extent it is used. This knowledge use assumes that people know about findings resulting from the investigations that generate it. Production and mobilization of knowledge are not new, nevertheless, such production and mobilization have occurred in developed countries from works and products research. In Colombia, in accordance with the Ministry of Science, Technology and Innovation, 5.772 groups of investigation are recognized by different institutions, and 16.799 researchers. The purpose of this article is to determine what are the means used by researchers in Colombia, to disseminate the results of their investigations. The methodology incorporates primary data, through a validated instrument by experts. Those results confirm that Colombian researchers still use traditional means to spread out such results. Very few of them use the emerging Information and Communication Technology for that purpose. Thus, an opportunity emerges for Researchers regarding the use of ICT in knowledge mobilization. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",2021
Organizational and social innovation in Non-Profit Organizations performance in the context of an emergent economy,Intangible Capital,"Purpose: This study provides empirical evidence on the innovations that Nonprofit Organizations (NPOs) in Colombia have implemented within their own management to address social problems which are the object of their institutional mission. Design/methodology: This research is based on information obtained from a survey applied to executives of Colombian NPOs. Multiple linear regression models were developed to check the partial effect of the set of independent variables (Organizational and Social Innovation) over the dependent variable (Organizational Performance). Main Components Analysis was applied to grouping the considered variables. Findings: Empirical evidence indicates that Colombian NPOs are innovative organizations that advisedly follow management strategies for this purpose. Colombian NPOs have been innovating for their disposition to tackle the social problems implicated in their institutional mission. Evidence indicates that the main components derived from NPOs' organizational and social innovations are grouped into four: NPO innovation actions to adapt to the environment; internal innovation actions to improve NPO's performance; variables related with NPO innovation actions to improve their relations with external agents; innovation actions aimed at improving the management of social interventions associated with the mission of the NPOs and the management of institutional projects. Research limitations/implications: The field work only used the survey technique to obtain the information and only assessed the perception of one of the directors of each of the NPOs participating in the study in terms of both the actions of organizational innovation such as social innovation and organizational performance. Therefore, the study undoubtedly presents bias in that perception. The technique used for the selection of the sample of the participants was a non-probabilistic sampling, which implies bias in the information and therefore, limitation for the generalization of the results to other contexts. The geographical location of the administration of the NPOs was restricted to Bogota and surrounding municipalities. Originality/value: An analysis of the relationship between social and organizational innovations with organizational performance in NPOs was carried out in the context of an emerging economy, where the subject has been very little studied and much less with principal component analysis. This in order to contribute to a better understanding of the subject. © 2021. All Rights Reserved.",2021
Quality certification and firm performance. The mediation of human capital,International Journal of Productivity and Performance Management,"Purpose: This paper investigates the impact of adopting quality management standards like ISO9001 on a firm's performance and the mediator role of human capabilities within firms in this relationship. The article analyses this mediator effect in the context of an emerging economy that set a policy reform aimed at increase ISO adoption and with a large share of informal labour markets. Design/methodology/approach: This study implements a quantitative approach, applying a Difference in Differences-DiD model with a Propensity Score Matching on fixed effect panel data analysis of a sample of certified and non-certified firms using firm-level data obtained from the national statistics office of Colombia. This methodology allows having comparable groups before the policy implementation. It reduces differences in observable characteristics and controls for parallel trends in primary outcomes before the policy reform. Findings: The research findings suggest that after Colombian policy reform of the quality system (2006), firms that adopted ISO 9001 certification increased innovation (5.2%), labour productivity (4.6%), sales (5.7%) and wages (4.9%). Furthermore, it shows that the share of permanent workers is an essential mediator in adopting quality programs. Adopters firms with a large percentage of temporary workers weaken their initial investment in quality infrastructure. Research limitations/implications: This research does not consider one key aspect. This is the lack of information about the organizational culture inside Colombian organizations that is related to a successful implementation of Quality Management standards like ISO 9001. However, it does not affect the conclusion about the mediation effect of human capital in the relationship between ISO 9001 and firm performance. Practical implications: The study covered all the Colombian manufacturing firms with ten or more employees. It provides critical insight for managers to value implementing ISO 9001 certification and appropriately put attention to enhancing their firms' human capital in emerging economies. Also, a policy implication of the paper is that governmental efforts to strengthen quality infrastructure in emerging economies should also include steps to increase a firm's investment in human capital. Originality/value: This study provides further support for government policies to strengthen firms' incentives to adopt modern management practices. The strong effects of implementing these management practices on sales, productivity and innovation have been identified. Furthermore, the investments in quality infrastructure must be accompanied by investment in human capital and workforce stability. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.",2021
Reconstruction of the chest wall with fixation in patients with tumor lesions. Case series [Reconstrucción de pared torácica con material de fijación en pacientes con lesiones tumorales. Serie de casos],Revista Colombiana de Cirugia,"Introduction. Surgical management of chest wall lesions with resection and reconstruction with prosthetic material has been increasing, due to advances in surgical techniques and surgeon’s experience, as well as innovation and characteristics of prosthetic materials. They allow wide resections of the wall, guaranteeing greater skeletal stability, less alteration of respiratory mechanics, and better aesthetic results. Methods. The experience in the CardioVID clinic, Medellín, Colombia, between the years 2015 and 2019, is presented through a retrospective review of eight cases that underwent resection of benign lesions of the chest wall and reconstruction with prosthetic material. Results. An adequate evolution of the patients was found, with a good aesthetic and functional result, with adequate control of the disease, without reports of complications or recurrence in follow-up. Discussion. An adequate technique allows the reconstruction of these defects with minimal complications and low prosthesis extraction rates, ending with excellent functional and cosmetic results. With our experience, we can conclude that the proper choice of patients who are good candidates for surgical management, a good surgical technique, and an experienced staff are crucial to achieve good results in terms of lung function and aesthetics results, in addition to obtain survival under the established parameters after achieving an R0 resection. © 2021, Asociacion Colombiana de Cirugia.

"Social innovation in rural communities: experience in the use of solid waste (Cauca, Colombia) [Innovación social en comunidadesrurales: Experiencia en aprovechamiento de residuos sólidos (Cauca, Colombia)]",Ager,"This paper presents the results of the project “Model of social innovation in the use of solid waste in the la Yunga and Río Hondo districts (Popayán, Cauca, Colombia)”. Through the means of community identified problems, its main goal was to promote community associative capabilities and socioenvironmental appropriation of territories in order to generate alternative methods of sustainable and sustained development. Methods such as People-centered design, Participatory Action Research and Environmental Education were applied. Results showed that social actors managed to devise, drive and deliver innovative and feasible solutions which made it possible to contribute to the objective of sustainable development and overall pollution reduction in the area. The design applied herein allowed for a collective vision to be built in order to direct community potentials and propose new forms of governance, in relevant elements of economic, social and environmental development of the rural sector. The study concludes that community efforts and their organizational capacity permitted the implementation of a social innovation model focused around the use of solid waste. This model can be replicated in rural areas at the national level, thus contributing towards the mitigation of adverse effects related to anthropic activities. Finally, community actions can influence public policies and participate in the overall transformation of local environment and territories. © 2021, CEDDAR. All rights reserved.",2021

Endogenous growth and integrationist organizational culture were the theoretical approaches followed by this study. The methodology was de-veloped in two stages: first, the relationship between innovation, human capital and production level was addressed from a longitudinal statistical analysis of the Survey of Technological Development and Innovation in the Manufacturing Industry; afterward, involvement and adaptability factors of the Denison Model were measured through the direct application of a survey to companies in the plastics sector. We found that the impact of staff skills on production is significant and that such impact increases when observing staff with higher education attainment. Besides, involvement and adaptability factors were located in intermediate areas in which the efficient use of production resources is moderate. © 2021, Universidad Nacional de Colombia.

Applying the strategic prospective approach to project management in a development project in Colombia,International Journal of Project Management,"International development projects face uncertainty challenges more often than other projects. The strategic prospective approach is based on understanding the future and accepting uncertainties. This theory is presented as an appropriate methodology for this type of projects. This study presents the case study of a development project designed and executed according to this discipline. The project involved implementing an innovative model of higher technical education and employability for low-income young people in the Department of Cauca (Colombia). The results show that despite the region's circumstances and the overall context, future problems were identified in advance, and this had a positive impact on the project. From international development, project management can learn flexibility to deal with the uncertainty and participative processes required for managing stakeholders, and the strategic prospective approach can be a good alliance in this challenge. © 2020",2020
Chivor’s life extension project (Clep): From sediment management to development of a new intake system,Water (Switzerland),"Sedimentation is an important issue that has been studied for the watershed of reservoirs, since it increases operational costs of hydropower installations, reduces the life expectancy, and compromises the generation capacity due to volume reduction. This work addresses the implementation of Chivor’s Life Extension Project (CLEP), developed in order to extend the life of La Esmeralda reservoir, which is used for power generation in Colombia. Sediment dynamics studies are first described and connected to the need of the AES Corporation to extend the life expectancy of the Chivor Hydropower Project. The geotechnical and hydraulic designs are described and the main considerations and tools for the execution of such a project are addressed. The construction of the new intake system was developed under favorable geomorphological, geological, and hydrogeological conditions, and the project is being developed without affecting the current operation. Such an innovative project is the first of its class in Colombia and goes from studies of sediment transport and sediment management strategies in the watershed to the design and construction of new intakes, in order to extend the life of an existing 1000-MW (6% of Colombia’s demand) powerplant for 50 more years, contributing to a sustainable energy supply for the future. © 2020 by the authors.

Several management and technological options with enteric methane mitigation potential have been evaluated and their scaling is anticipated to contribute toward achieving GHG emission reduction targets in the framework of the Paris Agreement. Yet, widespread adoption of promising mitigation options remains limited, raising questions as to whether envisaged emission reduction targets are achievable. Using findings from local studies, we explore the mitigation potentials of technologies and management practices currently proposed to mitigate enteric methane emissions from cattle production systems in the higher emitting countries of Latin America. We then discuss barriers for adopting innovations that significantly reduce cattle-based enteric methane emissions and the major shifts in policy and practice that are needed to raise national ambitions in the high emitting countries. Using the latest science and current thinking, we provide our perspective on an inclusive approach and re-imagine how the academic, research, business and public policy sectors can support and incentivize the changes needed to raise the level of ambition and achieve sustainable development goals (SDG), considering actions from the farm to the national scale. © Copyright © 2020 Arango, Ruden, Martinez-Baron, Loboguerrero, Berndt, Chacón, Torres, Oyhantcabal, Gomez, Ricci, Ku-Vera, Burkart, Moorby and Chirinda.",2020
Submerged vane technology in Colombia: Five representative projects,Water (Switzerland),"An innovative research-based technology has been applied for the first time in Colombia to improve the navigability of the Magdalena river in a zone of the city of Barrancabermeja, Department of Santander. The result of installation of the submerged vane technology demonstrated its effectiveness in sediment management and motivated its further use as a solution to problems of erosion, scour and meander evolution, which are common occurrence in the rivers of the country. Since this 1991 installation, more than 18 projects have been completed and the technical effectiveness of the system has been improved. Compared to traditional solutions, the results demonstrate beneficial economic impacts due to shorter execution times, reduction in annual maintenance costs, and diminished environmental impacts. Characteristics of design and construction and results obtained from five projects are described that are representative of the diversity of conditions and difficulties for the application of this technology in Colombia. Lessons learned for adaptation by river management authorities are derived from the study. © 2020 by the authors.",2020
A computer aided approach for river styles-inspired characterization of large basins: The Magdalena river (Colombia),Water (Switzerland),"This paper addresses the geomorphic characterization and classification of large rivers in a framework of scarce information. This is inspired by the River Styles Framework with some modifications that make the process more straightforward and accessible to practitioners and more applicable to large basins, while reducing the subjective, expert-based inputs, as the process is now more systematic. To this aim, it utilizes innovative criteria and some computer-aided procedures and tools based on GIS, Excel and Python. This approach sheds light on the character and the behavior of rivers, which is key to informing planning, management and restoration. The application to the Magdalena River (Colombia) illustrates the characterization and classification process and the type of results, which ultimately highlight the great geomorphic diversity of that river. The process is applicable to many other rivers worldwide. © 2020 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.",2020

Relevance of local knowledge in decision-making and rural innovation: A methodological proposal for leveraging participation of Colombian cocoa producers,Journal of Rural Studies,"The local knowledge is constituted in the basis for decision-making and is an important part of the livelihood of rural families. Knowledge of cocoa crop management practices takes an essential role in the producers’ resilience capacity to face and adapt to changing environments in the productive, social and environmental level. It was carried out a study in the Macarena-Guaviare region, Colombia to evaluate the level of knowledge of cocoa producers, to analyze how this knowledge is affected by familiar, organizational or productive variables, and to determine the formation needs. To determine the level of knowledge, it was proposed a methodology called “Cacota test” which was applied and validated by cocoa producers (n = 189). It was evaluated the knowledge about the links (a. Crop design, b. Clones, c. Soil fertility, d. Pruning, e. Pests and diseases management, f. Good agricultural practices, g. Harvest, h. Post-harvest, i. Transformation, j. Marketing, k. Associativity, l. Institutionality). By means of a cluster analysis, producers were typified according to their level of knowledge and it was made a principal component analysis (PCA) to visualize the relation between the links and types of producers. It was elaborated a Cocoa Knowledge Index (CKI) and the links with greater and lesser strength regarding management level were identified. Also, the variables which influence the CKI were identified using a linear regression model. Positive correlations were found between the links: a. Clones and Soil fertility, b. Pruning and good agricultural practices, c. Pruning and pests and diseases management. The typologies were affected by the level of education, level of associativity and cultivated area. The local knowledge was not significantly related to age and gender. The proposed methodology made possible to determine the level of local knowledge of cocoa crop management practices. The institutions or people responsible for the formation of cocoa producers in the Macarena-Guaviare region should focus on crop design, clones, soil fertility, harvest, post-harvest and transformation links. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",2020

Clean technology transfer and innovation in social housing production in Brazil and Colombia. A framework from a systematic review,Sustainability (Switzerland),"Over recent years in Brazil and Colombia, the social housing programs of these two countries have increasingly become directly related to the concept of green construction and seek to integrate with their respective laws. For example, a series of technological strategies allows bought countries to guarantee a reduction of the environmental impact of traditional construction technologies. Therefore, these actions try to answer the problems in the design of dwellings in Latin America. However, the construction sector reduced productivity and limited innovation in business. Some of the technological management processes in the social housing construction sector only consider the implementation of clean technologies tangentially. This situation is mainly because of general policies since they do not consider different local contexts. It is thenworth asking: What impact do the processes of transfer of clean technologies have on social housing in Brazil and Colombia? This systematic review was carried out on scientific papers indexed by the science database from 2013 to 2019. The PRISMA method was applied to this review with an aim to propose a conceptual model for the transfer of clean technology in the production of social housing in Brazil and Colombia. Finally, we identify that the impact of clean technologies transfer on social housing is very low in these two countries. © 2020 by the authors.",2020
Validity of dynamic capabilities in the operation based on new sustainability narratives on nature tourism SMEs and clusters,Sustainability (Switzerland),"This study aims to validate the relationships between the dynamic capabilities in the operation of small and medium enterprises (SMEs) that constitute the Nature Tourism Cluster (also known as ""ecotourism"") in Colombia, through the application of surveys to managers and owners of hotels and lodgings of rural tourism, travel agencies, tour guides and operators, bars, restaurants and tourist transport centers, whose data obtained, support our hypothesis that the dynamic capacities of absorption, adaptation and innovation influence the functioning of SMEs, while at the cluster level, there is an positive relationship in the interaction of absorption and innovation capabilities. The greatest contribution of our research consists in the development of an empirical study that is based on the main contributions of the dynamic capabilities promoted by Teece (absorption, adaptation and innovation), and that allowed to determine the degree of influence that managers have to take decisions and undertake sustainable ecotourism actions, both at the SME level and at the cluster level. For this reason, our research provides a better understanding of how dynamic capabilities operate at the individual commercial level, as well as at the cluster level, in the combination of absorption, adaptation and innovation capabilities to foster new sustainability narratives and maintain sustainable ecotourism. Our results also point out the limitations and challenges for the sustainable tourism sector in Colombia. © 2020 by the authors.",2020
Smart Lumini: A Smart Lighting System for Academic Environments Using IOT-Based Open-Source Hardware,Revista Facultad de Ingenieria,"Rational energy consumption in large buildings depends on both the users'consumption culture and the management systems implemented. In Colombia, few buildings have an energy management system characterized by its adaptability to the user and with a certain degree of intelligence. Thus, this document describes the summarized research process for the development of an Internet of Things (IoT) system, which has been designed to promote an intelligent lighting service in an academic environment. The IoT system orchestrates a series of sensors, monitoring systems and controlled actions, all based on the principle of making the system functions and consumption records available in real-time, via web services. The devices used are 'Things' with improved functionality, becoming ""Smart Things""within the IoT paradigm. Methodologically, an experimental process was followed, linking the development of electronic tools, the construction of services, and the development of interfaces for a pleasant user experience. Research contributes to two essential areas: intelligent buildings, through the intelligent adaptation of an environment; and sustainability and eco-innovation, since the system provides appropriate information for environmental education, in terms of real-time energy consumption, that impacts directly on the fair-use culture of a service expensive for the environment.

Innovation capabilities in health organizations. Proposal of a model through structural equation models [Capacidades de innovación en las organizaciones de salud. Propuesta de un modelo mediante ecuaciones estructurales],Revista de Metodos Cuantitativos para la Economia y la Empresa,"In the present work, we try to find the determinants of innovation capabilities in the health care organizations. Firstly, the structural and measurement model was elaborated to account the relations between the latent variables and the manifest ones. Secondly, the model was identified; subsequent to this, we proceeded to calculate the adjustment indexes and using some techniques of multivariate methods. Then, we analyzed the areas of the model that did not fit properly to intervene them and thus achieve an optimal adjustment. We proposed some hypothesis that allowed us to prove positive causal relationships between the Innovation Capabilities and the variables. We had 283 observations extracted from the network of high complexity hospitals in Colombia during the years 2016 and 2017. A model with a significant adjustment that would account for the triggers of Innovation Capabilities in health care organizations was obtained. Finally, the positive impact of knowledge management, human resource management, management capabilities, organizational culture, and some factors associated with the health care Organizations on Innovation Capabilities was demonstrated. © 2020, Revista de Metodos Cuantitativos para la Economia y la Empresa.

An exploratory study of corporate entrepreneurship in latin america,"Proceedings of the European Conference on Innovation and Entrepreneurship, ECIE","Generating new products, services, or technologies may require drawing on available entrepreneurial human resources within the firm. Allowing an organizational climate in which employees engage as internal entrepreneurs can serve as a conduit for in-house generation of innovations. In order to sustain such innovative activity within a firm, corporate entrepreneurship integrates intentional and visible organizational conducts to engage employees in entrepreneurial behaviours that allow for revitalization and strategic renewal. In an understanding that an organizational climate influences employees behaviors, studies have found that certain organizational dimensions can increase employees' perceptions of organizational support that elicit their willingness to pursue entrepreneurial initiatives. In emerging and developing economies prevails a disparity on the capacity of firms to create an organizational climate that taps into the entrepreneurial behaviors of employees. In Latin America, even though many companies develop some type of innovation, the innovative performance of many firms lags significantly behind that of developed economies. The aim of this paper is to assess the perception of employees on five key dimensions in ten Latin American firms located in Colombia, Ecuador, Mexico, and Honduras from five different industries. To this end, the Corporate Entrepreneurship Climate Instrument (CECI) was applied to assess (1) top management support, (2) employee autonomy, (3) rewards/reinforcement, (4) time availability, and (5) organizational boundaries. Results from multivariate analysis show that the role of top managers within the company appears as one of the main inhibitors to entrepreneurial behaviour, highlighting the need for improving top management's sensitivity to supporting entrepreneurial activity of employees. Findings also reveal that employees perceive a weakness of organizational resources and incentives to entrepreneurial behavior. The practical implication of this exploratory study is that as long as traditional managerial conducts are not transformed, entrepreneurial individuals will not flourish in detriment of higher innovative organizational performance. © 2020 Academic Conferences and Publishing International Limited.

"Design and validation of an intellectual capital management model for the quality of higher education institutions, Colombia [Diseño y validación de un modelo de gestión del capital intelectual para la calidad de instituciones de educación superior, Colombia]",Interdisciplinaria,"The results of the design and validation of an Intellectual Capital (CI) management model for the quality of IES, Colombia 2014-2016 are shown. Applied research, mixed-nature. The qualitative approach was from the confrontation of the theory with the specific conditions of the object addressed (its characteristics and needs) which allowed the design of the model. The quantitative data approach was statistical. The population corresponds to the educational actors (teachers, students, administrative and management) of the medicine program, a total of 2139. The sampling was stratified and to determine the size of each of the stratum, took into account the population variances of the same and opted to use the criterion of Neyman's Affixation. For data analysis, they were presented in frequency distribution tables, with range and confidence interval measurements at 95 % (CI-95 %). Also, to observe the relationship between the variables (aspects) and the actors, a simple correspondence analysis was performed. All information was processed in the R-CRAN program. Seven surveys were designed which were validated by experts in higher education, who qualified coherence with the objectives of the study, the shape of the instrument and the clarity of the questions. The analysis of theories on intellectual capital allowed the design of the systemic-dynamic model of management of intellectual capital for the quality of institutions of higher education-SIDIGCIES, is based on three theories: Theory of dynamic capacities in the business world, of Teece, Pisano and Shuen; And, Theory of knowledge creation of Nonaka and Takeuchi. The guidelines of the National Accreditation Council (CNA) of Colombia were also taken into account for both programs and institutions. It is structured by four dynamic subsystems: human talent, research and innovation, academic administration and Social recognition. Its name is due to the way the management of intellectual capital in the IES must work, which requires an interconnected system, whose relationship is developed in a dynamic and non-static way when it is constantly moving, constantly improving and Adjustments, in constant internal interaction in each one of its elements and with the external medium. It is precisely the continuous interaction between the members of the Organization and other external agents in a careful way, which leads to the creation of new knowledge. Around the dynamic subsystems the elements that make possible the promotion and distribution of knowledge are undulating, they are: tacit knowledge, explicit knowledge, organizational knowledge and inter-organizational knowledge. In turn, the dynamic subsystems are influenced by four elements that directly affect their integral behavior and the achievement of the objectives of the IES. Without them, is not possible effective management of intellectual Capital; these are: Financial condition, national and international context, ethical-Legal aspects and physical infrastructure and material resources. The validation of the model in a medical program showed the relevance of SIDIGCIES, with the national and international requirements established for the accreditation of programs and institutions. We achieved the design of 92 indicators for measurement, distributed in each of the subsystems with this is possible a comprehensive analysis of their reality and not fractionally. Seven instruments were also designed for the actors of the teaching-learning process duly validated, counting in this way with reliable tools of measurement of the management of the CI SIDIGCIES, that allows the systematic and interdisciplinary study, oriented to identify the intellectual resources to share, employ, keep and protect them at the individual, organizational, social and global levels. It is a tool that will orient the proper management of the CI, will motivate the recognition of the value of the human talent for the production of the intangibles that there are produced, towards the recognition of the quality by the society and the State. © 2020 Centro Interamericano de Investigaciones Psicologicas y Ciencias Afines.",2020

Social entrepreneurship and sustainable tourism in Colombia: A baseline study in post-conflict regions,"International Journal of Sustainability in Economic, Social, and Cultural Context","This article analyses the presence of sustainable tourism and social entrepreneurship in various Colombian regions, which are currently undergoing post-conflict management, in order to establish a baseline against which to monitor and assess future tourism initiatives and growth. The study was done using a qualitative methodology that included semi-structured interviews with tourism actors, with four main dimensions: social, economic, political, and environmental. The research revealed that, after the signing of the peace treaty, tourism in previously conflict-affected regions significantly increased due to the growth of privately owned tourism enterprises focused on profit making. However, levels of sustainable development, community involvement, and social entrepreneurship initiatives remain low; hence, the tourism value chain needs to be strengthened with local community involvement in order to reconstruct the social fabric. This can be done with social entrepreneurial practice, through sustainable tourism, or Sustainable Social Tourism, considered an innovative model that empowers communities and contributes to peace building. © Common Ground Research Networks, Luz Dary González-Cortés, Soraya Husain-Talero, All Rights Reserved.",2020

To do so, a descriptive case study is developed applying a valuation method based on an existing model. This way, a maturity level was determined for the studied capacity. This valuation is built with primary information taken from semi-structured interviews to the directors and administrative staff in the health care provider facilities. This information was compared to the policies, strategies, processes, resources and other secondary information provided by the health care provider itself. The results thus obtained show that the innovation capacity in this IPS is heterogeneous as the dimensions thereof are not uniform, and fluctuate between extreme ends. It is due to the fact that the innovation activities in the IPS are processes requiring some formalization and strengthening. Possibly what they need is an innovation management system that enables to prioritize the problems and focus the efforts in specific action lines. © 2019 Pontificia Universidad Javeriana.

Innovation in Latin America through the lens of bibliometrics: crammed and fading away,Scientometrics,"Research in the field of innovation in business, management, and accounting (BMA) in Latin America (LATAM) has surpassed all expectations of its net output. Yet this digital tide suggests several concerns regarding its impact and both its established and emergent research topics at the individual, institutional, and country level. In this paper, an outlook of the field was developed based on a sample of + 1300 documents indexed in Scopus from 1983 to 2018. Public institutions in Brazil and Colombia have been both the most cited and productive in the region. Nevertheless, documents lead by non-LATAM authors showed significant differences in both paper citations and journals’ h-index compared to leading authors from LATAM. Three of the major concerns raised were, first, a growing inter-regional gap among LATAM countries. Second, the intensive use of a journal with predatory features over the last 5 years, therefore cites/document measure is at the lowest point of the past 17 years. And third, the delay of recently emergent topics in the region that have been in the literature for more than a decade, while frontier topics for BMA innovation such as those of Industry 4.0 remain unnoticed. © 2019, The Author(s).",2019

Effectiveness of a case management model for the comprehensive provision of health services to multi-pathological people [向多种疾病患者全面提供医疗服务的案例管理模式的有效性],Journal of Advanced Nursing,"Aim: To determine the effectiveness of a case management model for approaching multi-pathological people in a health promoting entity of the contributory healthcare scheme in Bogotá, Colombia between 2018 -. Design: Mixed methods research. Method: The study contemplates two components: a quantitative component using a quasi-experimental analytical design before and after longitudinal intervention to determine the effectiveness of the case management model and a qualitative descriptive design to understand the experience of the participants about the model. The Administrative Department of Science, Technology and Innovation of Colombia (Colciencias) funded this project by means of call 777—November 2017, under the financing agreement No. 848—December 2017. Discussion: Addressing problems deriving from the structure of the Colombian healthcare system is crucial for implementing case management models. Furthermore, the effectiveness of such models may be affected by power relations and market failures, but the proved potential of a model may represent a generalized benefit for the Colombian health system. Impact: In Colombia, considering complications and management of chronic non-communicable diseases as isolated cases is considered as the highest cost events in healthcare provision, since an average of 12.8 million pesos is invested in each patient. This has led to rethink the management in these patients by means of a comprehensive model that guarantees the effectiveness of healthcare delivery, in the framework of a healthcare system heavily affected by payment capacity, where the market has a strong predominance, such as the case of Colombia.

Cycles of action and reflection as the basis of transformative innovation,Management Research Review,"Purpose: This paper aims at explaining the design process of a learning model targeting potential entrepreneurs with no technical or business expertise aiming to develop sustainable business models in deprived areas. The case that the paper explores focuses on experiential learning and learning in adulthood to design a learning model that considers context and socio-demographic characteristics, makes clear the interconnections between sustainability principles, entrepreneurship rationale and design methodologies and includes actions and processes of reflection and contextual interaction. Design/methodology/approach: Following a recursive argument, the paper applies design research methodology (DRM) to systematically design the “transformative innovation model” that Product Co Creation Centers (PC3) from the University of Twente (The Netherlands) has developed. Findings: Building on Kolb’s cycle of experiential learning, the result of applying DRM is a learning cycle of confrontation, observation, practice and application. The proposed learning model is applied to a specific setting in Colombia, allowing to verify and validate whether the learning model leads to the expected outcomes. It is argued that an interdisciplinary approach, a focus on feedback loops and the consideration of the context are important elements for addressing and transforming complex problems related to sustainable development from the bottom-up. Originality/value: This paper contributes to academic research in management emphasizing a solution-finding approach based on a prescription-driven research process, informed by design science research. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.",2019

From a business perspective, technology and knowledge are fundamental assets for the growth and sustainability of the organization, being these the pillars on which competitiveness and its differentiation in the market are based. Today, technological development and the creation of new and improved products and services have become drivers for the global economy, whereas emerging as challenges for organizations that must keep pace with the advance of science, technology and innovation if they want to remain in the market being competitive and generating returns (Rios and Marroquín, 2012). Technology transfer strategies then become drivers and generators of knowledge that impact the development of technological capabilities in the company and directly or indirectly promote the growth of a sector of the economy. These types of projects bring with them an effort on the part of the organizations that use personnel, resources and time in a transfer process in search of the increase of their technological capacities and business development. In Colombia, for example, technology-based organizations are companies that usually make use of this type of transfer processes such as licensing agreements, technical assistance and services contracts, mobility of personnel towards other industries, company mergers or acquisitions or intellectual property rights, with the objective of impacting their business growth through the development of new and better products and services for the benefit of their clients, in addition to impacting the country’s industrial development. An example of this is the Corporación de Ciencia y Tecnología para el Desarrollo de la Industria Naval, Marítima y Fluvial—COTECMAR (Science and Technology Corporation for the Development of the Naval, Maritime and Fluvial Industry), which by developing technology transfer projects has achieved the country’s technological independence in terms of the manufacture of ships and naval devices, appropriating technologies and knowledge from shipyards with the most experience in the world. Given this situation, this article presents a conceptualization and establishes the main characteristics of technology transfer processes, tracks the main contributions of authors and institutions towards the evaluation of the effects of such projects on the growth of the company and finally proposes a process for the evaluation of their impact through a practical case. The evaluation methodology is based on the disaggregation of dimensions used by the Logical Framework Methodology guided by the four approaches put forward by Daniel Stufflebeam to carry out an evaluation process. © IAMOT 2019.",2019
"A tool for the interpretation of organizational myths: The case of innovation in the City of MedellÃ­n, Colombia",Organizational Cultures,"Considering that myths in organizations tell stories that allow recognizing a set of values, beliefs and ideologies that imprint individuality to the organization, the purpose of this study is to propose a conceptual tool for Organizational management by analyzing and interpreting myths in organizations. Said tool can be easily implemented, as it is shown in its practical application to the analysis of innovation in the city of MedellÃ­n, Colombia. In the past, MedellÃ­n was associated with drug trafficking and destruction and today is considered the most innovative city in the world. By applying the proposed tool to the innovation case of MedellÃ­n, it is possible to analyze and understand how this transformation was possible in the city of MedellÃ­n and how the myth of management is an intermediary between the myth of referenceâ€”paradigm of the pastâ€”and the organizational mythâ€”associated with organizational goals.

Knowledge transfer from universities to regions as a network spreading process,"4th IEEE International Symposium on Systems Engineering, ISSE 2018 - Proceedings","In developing countries it is necessary to understand how knowledge transfer (KT) occurs via human capital from universities to regions. This transfer can be viewed as diffusion process and is one essential factor in explaining regional innovation and resulting socioeconomic developments. This phenomenon has been studied at the organizational level, however there are few contributions that consider spreading process models over networks in the macro context. This paper presents a KT model of human capital from university nodes to productive organization nodes for seven Colombian regions, and examines how the proportion of graduates absorbed by each region generates new knowledge products. The phenomenon we consider is based on the susceptible-infected-susceptible (SIS) epidemic process, where the spread parameters are related to the knowledge absorption capacity and the ineffectiveness or unused knowledge of the previous spreading process in the region. In addition, the model tries to explain the dependence of knowledge products (KP) with Science, Technology, Engineering and Math (STEM) graduates and the productive structure complexity. To validate the model, we have used the data of13 consecutive years obtained from the Education Ministry, as well as from the Science and Technology Observatory of Colombia. Our findings reflect that the proposed model explains the KT phenomenon, where each node or region is a heterogeneous node, because they have different absorption and ineffectiveness parameters, as well as, diverse productive structure configurations. © 2018 IEEE.",2018
Modes of learning and profitability in Colombian and Mexican SMEs,Journal of High Technology Management Research,The aim of this study is to analyze the effects of different modes of learning on innovation and profitability in SMEs in two Latin American countries; Mexico and Colombia.

Results show that an integrated mode of learning based on internal and external knowledge supported by technological infrastructure have positive and significant effects on the degree of innovation and the profitability in SMEs However this effect appears to be not significantly different from the traditional SMEs mode of learning based mainly on market orientation. © 2018,2018
Productive chain management around disruptive technologies. Engaging sustainability and materials research,IOP Conference Series: Materials Science and Engineering,"Mining is always a controversial issue and mainly when the discussion is addressed to developing countries. In Colombia, the mining panorama was and continues to be ruled by a formal, modern, and large-scale mining mainly focused in coal, the exploitation of nickel, and some companies that exploit gold in different places. Also, a large part of the mining activity is done at minor scales, defined in many cases by informality and the subsistence character. Bearing sustainability in mind, it is worth asking about the balance implies by the exploitation without added value of local and strategic materials that are irreversibly scarcer every time, including metallic and non-metallic minerals. Opportunities around natural and non-renewable resources must focus on enhancing the quality of life, the question addressed here is how to penetrate in the global markets of sophisticated products as well as how to be serious about the so-called ""innovation"", but with accent on sustainability and disruptive technologies. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",2018
Facilitating business collaborations for industrial symbiosis: The pilot experience of the sustainable industrial network program in Colombia,Sustainability (Switzerland),"Industrial symbiosis refers to a collaborative strategy of exchanging physical resources and sharing services among industrial actors, which enhances the resource efficiency and reduces the environmental impacts of industrial operations within the network. Although it can contribute to sustainable development in emerging economies, few studies have examined the dynamics of industrial symbiosis in such regions. We initiated a capacity-building pilot program for industrial symbiosis in Colombia and formulated 20 industrial symbiosis projects with 36 companies. Based on our experience over the first year, we conducted an exploratory case study of the mechanisms that facilitate the development of industrial symbiosis. Specifically, we analyzed the nature of this facilitation and how its activities influence the key determining factors of industrial symbiosis in technical, economic, organizational, social, and institutional categories. Our facilitation approach focused on identifying opportunities and building capacity for industrial symbiosis innovation by influencing mainly the organizational and social factors. The facilitation approach requires further adjustments and experimentation to expand industrial symbiosis and to ensure the eventual implementation of these projects. This study contributes to the understanding of management perspectives of industrial symbiosis development in the context of an emerging economy. © 2018 by the authors.",2018

Challenges in implementing the extended producer responsibility in an emerging economy: The end-of-life tire management in Colombia,Journal of Cleaner Production,"With increasing problems related to the management of end-of-life products, emerging economies have adopted an environmental policy principle – Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR), following the example of OECD countries. Colombia was one of the early adopters in Latin America, having introduced EPR in 2007 to manage several end-of-life products, such as pesticide containers, medicines, lead acid batteries, light bulbs, small batteries, computers, and tires. However, there has been no comprehensive investigation into how EPR has been applied in the context of Colombia. Using the case of end-of-life tires, this study aimed to provide an understanding about two aspects of the EPR system in Colombia: the governance structure and the performance in the end-of-life management. This study found that the Colombian EPR governance model imposes full financial and operational responsibilities on tire producers and importers, while it fails to incentivize other actors in the product chain to carry out their allocated tasks and responsibilities. As for the performance, the EPR system has increased the amount of tires collected over the last five years, but the level is low compared with other developed countries, and more importantly, it does not fully promote the recovery of values from tire waste. The analysis of the current situation in Colombia and lessons from other countries suggest that the effectiveness of the EPR policy would require the establishment of solid, but feasible targets, while allowing flexibility in meeting those targets. It would also benefit from the consideration of economic instruments, as well as establishment of complementary policies to promote innovation and strengthen the regulatory controls over the free riders and management of tire waste. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",2018
"Corporate universities as a new paradigm and source of social innovation, sustainability, technology and education in the XXI century",Strategies and Best Practices in Social Innovation: An Institutional Perspective,"In recent years, Corporate Universities have become a critical element in the development of human capital inside companies, institutions and organizations, promoting strategies based on knowledge management as an essential factor to achieve social innovation and sustainable competitive advantages aligned with the strategy. Therefore it is essential for these institutions to reach the highest levels of efficiency and excellence in company processes and structures and to achieve planned corporate goals and objectives. In this work an extensive and thorough review of the current literature was carried out in relation to the concept, in order to analyse the latest trends in Corporate Universities. A comparative evaluation with traditional university aspects was performed, identifying their own differentiators, for example the impact on social innovation, the development of sustainable com- petitive advantages, the influence on the company's internal environment, the importance of cultural and technological factors, and the relationship with the orga- nizations strategy, which are important factors in its successful development and interconnection within the company processes. The information obtained from the aforementioned literature review, in combination with the experience gained by the team of consultants and researchers at the PRIME Business School, Sergio Arboleda University, Bogota, Colombia, allowed to present proposed in general terms a new implementation model of Corporate University. This new model is based on five distinct phases, and with minor adaptations could be to any sector in an organization. The study shows that through this Corporate University model, an organization could gain differentiators to increase social innovation, in time gain sustainable competitive advantages, and a desirable alignment with the objectives and strategic goals of the organization. © Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature 2018.

Two techniques are accepted, one of them is the Exploratory Factor Analysis (AFE), and the other, the Confirmatory Factor Analysis (AFC). The sample consisted of 200 observations obtained from the network of high complexity hospitals in Colombia during 2016 and 2017. The research shows a valid instrument from its constructs and determinants (Knowledge Management, Human Resource Managament, Organizational Capabilities, Culture, and finally those associated with the Health Care Organizations). Furthermore, the results of the Confirmatory Factorial Analysis allowed to test the theoretical model. This type of initiative is pioneer for three reasons: 1) The application of the methods to the health sector; 2) the conceptual amplitude of a large number of internal predictors of the Innovation Capabilities and 3) the existence of some descriptive studies is detected, with special attention to innovation in a general way, but the intention of the present work goes far beyond the merely prescriptive works, tries to demonstrate by means of quantitative techniques the singularities of innovation capabilities in the health sector. © 2018 Academia Nacional de Medicina.

Social responsibility and welfare of elderly people [Responsabilidad social y bienestar de la persona mayor],"CIRIEC-Espana Revista de Economia Publica, Social y Cooperativa","In recent years, there has been a change in the topic of protection of the elderly in the world, due to the demographic transition process involving growth in the aging of the population and the foreseeable consequences. This is the reason why there has been a need for a common frame of reference for the welfare, protection and promotion of the rights of the elderly, including the contribution they can make to society, as well as the products and services that they perceive according to the requirements they demand. This article shares some results of the study*, carried out between 2012 and 2015 in two contexts, Colombia and Spain, whose objective was to understand the social reality of a growing market segment and the importance of current government and social policies for the protection and quality of life in senior citizen population. Health deteriorates generally as it advances in age, requiring special attention in the medium and long term, transposed into greater demand for services for the older person. Social economy companies are called to take action on the matter, considering, in truth, of components of the social quadrihelix, composed of: a) academia, through the approach of new professional skills, the exchange of experiences and the promotion of good practices, in addition to research and innovation for the elderly, b) the company, generating or providing appropriate services and products for this population, c) local, regional and national government through the enactment and implementation of the national policy of aging, seeking the protection and defense of the rights of the elderly, and d) the community, through volunteering and the inclusion of the person in conditions of social vulnerability. Thus, the four fronts, imply the commitment that both the citizen and the institutions have to society, in a common work under the same purpose, make visible the degree of corporate and institutional social responsibility and the implementation in benefit of appropriately intervening the situation of old age of population, coordinating and promoting national and international cooperation initiatives that create links with different stakeholders, in order to meet the needs, desires, expectations and tastes, through the quality and relevance of the service perceived by the older person, both in the residences where they live, the products they buy and consume, inside and outside the environment where they reside. The advances of science in recent years has been vertiginous, in a more significant way in medicine and in the new technologies applied to medical science in the pharmacological field, favouring longevity with quality life for the elderly, providing them with the opportunity for more autonomy, physical and mental activity. At the same time, it means that companies and institutions must offer new and better services in accordance with the expectations and needs, not only of the elderly, but also of the family members and administrative staff of the home/residence who need to improve the well-being of the person in charge of, allowing the user to make their own decisions of where to live, what products to consume, which brands and characteristics according to benefits they perceive and require. This is how, from the theoretical review on key conceptions of the elderly**, the demographic trends, the institutional framework of welfare policies in protection and social responsibility that affect the population of the elderly and that could influence health, housing, security and pensions, the variables to be taken into account were defined and three structured surveys and a questionnaire were designed to obtain primary information, highlighting the residences as a starting point and the public involved: seniors, relatives, directors of residential centers and subject matter experts. Allowing to contextualize ""in a general way"" the social welfare, the socioeconomic situation of the elderly population and the social policies that shelter it, as well as the business environment considered a challenge in the population aging process, which goes from managing human talent as a strategic asset in a competitive society until defining and implementing inclusive public policies. Reaching some theories and approaches of entrepreneurship social responsibility and the relationship between business / senior citizens, starting from the liberal relation to the approach of social institutions and thus get to relate some considerations of the residential environment (Colombia-Spain) and quality components of life as a foundation of the social welfare of the elderly as a being of multiple and interdependent needs. Finally, the study shows how, in Spain, in contrast to Colombia, interventions for the benefit of the elderly are notable, from the relationship with workers, volunteers and families. Meanwhile, corporate relations in social management, cooperation and solidarity, are found to be more visible in Spain as a comprehensive strategy and social content, however in both contexts there are gaps in innovation, in processes and products for the activity and physical mobility of this population. In same way, they are also working on the relationship: social responsibility / innovation. In Colombia, some progress has been made, but there is still a lack of promotion, articulation and initiatives of internal and external social responsibility, since there are no clear guidelines in a social responsibility management system that supports initiatives and proposals to manage participation or links with other entities of different sectors. However, in both contexts, it is necessary to coordinate and promote national and international cooperation, which allow the link with different stakeholders, in order to achieve the satisfaction of needs and desires, as well as the quality and relevance of perceived service by the older adult, in the residences and in the external environment where they reside. © 2018 CIRIEC-España.",2018

City profile: Medellin,Cities,"After being known as the ‘murder capital of the world’ in the 1990s, Medellin has pioneered innovative forms of city planning and management and was acclaimed the most innovative city in the world by the Urban Land Institute (ULI) in 2013. Hosting the World Urban Forum in 2014 allowed it to showcase its approach, key elements of which have been: creation of innovative transport infrastructure linking poorer peripheral districts to the city centre; culture-led regeneration; strong support of local development from the local business sector; and a successful municipally-owned utilities company. However, the city is spreading outwards without services and employment being provided; new low-income developments are replicating high-rise models which failed worldwide; there is limited intervention in the existing informal areas, many being in highly vulnerable locations where the level of risk is likely to increase with climate change; development has little regard for topography, ecological and environmental considerations; investment in accessible and good quality public space is restricted to some areas; the quality of the public realm does not always support health and wellbeing of the ageing population. This paper explores the institutional and socio-economic context in which Medellín has achieved the internationally recognized status of an ‘innovative city’. It questions to what extent social equity, environmental sustainability and citizen empowerment have been promoted as per the ULI claims when it conferred the prize. The paper queries the extent to which ‘urban innovation’ is happening in Medellín, which has considerable implications given its recently found role as a ‘model’ city in Latin America and beyond. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",2018

Managing of second-degree facial burns with amniotic membrane preserved en 85% glycerol [Manejo de quemaduras faciales de segundo grado con membrana amniótica preservada en glicerol 85%],Cirugia Plastica Ibero-Latinoamericana,"Background and Objective. Seventy percent of the major burn patients have face burns and their surgical management depends on the depth of the burn; usually full thickness burns have to undergo early tangential excision with immediate coverage once the patient is stable and in the partial thickness facial burns the surgical management is dermoabrasion and coverage with topical agents, synthetic dressings or biological dressings. However, the dressing changes with topical agents are painful and frequent procedures and many of the synthetic and biological dressings are expensive and not available for some health systems. The aim of this study was to evaluate the use of amniotic membrane glicerol preserved 85%, as a transient biological dressing in the management of partial and total thickness facial burns. Methods. We developed an observational descriptive prospective study case series of 52 consecutive patients. We used exposed 85% glycerol preserved amniotic membrane as a transient biological coverage provided by the Science, Biotechnology and Innovation District Institute of Health (IDCBIS) of the Health Secretary of Bogotá (Colombia), without secondary dressings, immediately after mechanic dermoabrasion in patients with partial and total thickness facial burns. Results. All the patients epithelialized between the 5th and 10th day with only one application of the amniotic membrane without secondary dressings or topical agents; also the patients did not show wound healing alterations. Some patients stayed in the hospital longer than 10 days because they presented major burns. None of them presented infection and all referred absence of pain during the postoperative period. Conclusions. The use of amniotic membrane as a transient biological dressing for the treatment of partial and total thickness facial burns is an economic, effective and available tool in countries with skin banks.

"Social innovation, productive chain and sustainable value: Proposal for tourist atractions in the municipality usiacur [Innovacion social, Cadena socioproductiva y valor sostenible: Propuesta para destinos turisticos en el municipio usiacuri]","Proceedings of the 32nd International Business Information Management Association Conference, IBIMA 2018 - Vision 2020: Sustainable Economic Development and Application of Innovation Management from Regional expansion to Global Growth","Colombia is one of the countries of Latin America, which has been cutting edge in sustainable development policies, both that presented, at the UN Conference on sustainable development in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, 2012, considerable progress in formulating the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), with a proposal for environmental approach to the protection of biodiversity (forests, rivers and oceans). In this sense following the guidelines of the SDGs and the 2030 world agenda, this studie fixes its gaze in Usiacurí, recognized municipality as the Manger of the Colombian Caribbean, whose potential as a tourist destination were characterized in the Strategic Plan of development ecotourism, tourism and Cultural (PEDETC) of the municipality Usiacurí 2007-2017, in this sense the objective focused on formulating a proposal deemed social innovation, the chain partner productive and inclusive tourism and its sustainable value to tourist destinations located in the municipality Usiacurí. The research is descriptive and analytical, data will be collected through primary sources (application of surveys representatives of the governmental sector, members of the Foundation for the progress of Usiacurí (COPROUS), cooperative Weaver's) Usiacurí (COOPUS), the community in general and secondary sources literature review and internet sources. Results correspond to the first objective to determine the scope of the strategies designed in the PEDETC for its positioning as a tourist destination, denoting divergent views among the respondents, since the 73.78% consider that the PEDETC is has developed, while the 26.21% thinks that many of their strategies have paralyzed or not have been initiated. This leads to think that in general the PEDECT paid off, even though the results of the rest of goals will give one much greater insight allowing orienting a proposal that makes a tourist destination of Usiacurí.

Productive chains of peace,"Proceedings of the 20th International Conference on Engineering and Product Design Education, E and PDE 2018","This project was developed by ASOMENORES, a social foundation which aims the resocialisation of criminal Juvenile Offenders’ Law in Bolivar Department in Colombia, in association with the Industrial Design Programme from Jorge Tadeo Lozano University in Bogota, and other stakeholders from the Bolivar region. The main goal of this project was to contribute in social and economic reinsertion of young offenders within society by developing labour and social skills, and, therefore, helping them to improve their livelihood and life quality. The strategy consisted in a participatory design and implementation of the project named ""Popular Design, Productive Chains and Peace Building"" in the municipalities of Cartagena and Turbaco (Bolivar, Colombia). The project envisioned not only teaching to these minors inmates how to build handcrafts, but also included the construction of sustainable productive chains providing great value to their artisanal work. These NEOCraftstrategy (handicrafts renovation movement) included the handmade products transcendence, its environmental responsibility, the use of natural materials and waste management. Therefore, the fundamental value of the craftsmanship lies on its cultural and ancestral tradition that gives uniqueness to the product, separating it from the mass and global consumption of branded products. For ASOMENORES, and for this specific project, the social rehabilitation and reinsertion into society depends on various factors: one of them is the psychological rehabilitation provided by the penitentiary; another factor, the intervention was originated by this project through the construction of productive chains. The strategy was focused on determining skills’ assessment of each participant. From that starting point, the result was the development of individual, technical and competitive advantages. These advantages emphasised over their culture, traditions and perspectives, where was planned to create and innovate with systemic awareness, inclusive and participative added value. It is expecting once the participants are resealed, they will be prepare, with proper tools, to be part of different companies as employees or create their own business. In this way, there is a high probability of decreasing their chances for these young guys to commit an offence again. The innovation of this project lies on the fact that different aspects such as the legal and social components are being intervened from the Design’s Perspective, aimed to achieve institutional changes where all the stakeholders will be benefited from the project, starting with young inmates and their families, and those involved in the training process such as psychologists, teachers and penitentiary guardians, and foremost, the Industrial Design students who managed and experience the development of an educational process from a sustainable productive standpoint. © 2018 Institution of Engineering Designers The Design Society.

A structural diagnosis of the regional innovation system of Bogota: A tool for policy-making,IISE Annual Conference and Expo 2018,"Countries like Japan, South Korea, Israel and Sweden, among others, has proven that the value of a region does not depend solely from natural resources, but intellectual capital is also necessary to create capabilities towards regional development. Bogota, the biggest city of Colombia, concentrates most of the financial and human resources of the country. However, the indexes and measures of regional innovation does not reflect this capability of the city, and most the structures supporting the innovational plans of Bogota are ill implemented or not implemented at all. Even if transform a resources-based economy to a knowledge-based is slow, an appropriate structure and clear roles of the public and private organizations could boost this change. Therefore, this research shows an analysis of the structure of the regional innovation system (RIS), specially focused on information flows, cooperation mechanisms, and collaborative work. Using rigorous organizational cybernetics methods and social network analysis, an initial diagnosis shows that the RIS of Bogota does not connect properly each one of the activities of the system within organizations. Likewise, a lack of communication and control mechanisms result in fragmentation between subsystems and their activities. Based on these results, a proposal for a synergetic network is presented, where resources and activities are tied up. This proposal of public policy shows the advantages of the changes on the relationships between actors, and possible improvement on the communication and control mechanisms. © 2018 Institute of Industrial Engineers (IIE).

Characteristics of the Colombian solidarity economy. Approaches to influential currents in Colombia [Características de la economía solidaria colombiana. Aproximaciones a las corrientes influyentes en Colombia],"CIRIEC-Espana Revista de Economia Publica, Social y Cooperativa","En Colombia, la procedencia teórica y doctrinal para la definición y conceptualización de lo que se entiende por economía solidaria no es muy clara, por esto consideramos la realización de un proyecto de investigación que nos llevará a ello. El primer resultado se presenta en este artículo. El objeto del mismo es presentar la reflexión teórica que nos permitirá tener una guía de análisis para definir la economía solidaria en Colombia. A través de una metodología cualitativa basada en el método de análisis documental y utilizando diferentes técnicas de recolección de información, analizamos dos corrientes demográficas que han tenido incidencia en la definición de la economía solidaria en Colombia. La primera es la corriente latinoamericana y la segunda es la corriente de economía social y solidaria. Finalmente hacemos una revisión del marco normativo para proponer algunos elementos teóricos que son la base de la investigación. Este artículo es la realización del primer objetivo específico del proyecto en mención. © 2018 CIRIEC-España.In Colombia, the theoretical and doctrinal origin for the definition and conceptualization of what is understood by solidary economy is not very clear, for this reason we consider the realization of a research project that will lead us to this. The first result is presented in this article. The objective is to present the theoretical reflection that will allow us to have an analysis guide to define the solidarity economy in Colombia. Through a qualitative methodology based on the method of documentary analysis and using different information collection techniques, we analyze two demographic trends that have had an impact on the definition of solidarity economy in Colombia. The first is the Latin American current and the second is the current social and solidarity economy. Finally, we review the regulatory framework to propose some theoretical elements that are the basis of the investigation. This article is the realization of the first specific objective of the project in mention. As results, we find that in Latin America we can mention two currents. The first refers to the ethical- moral current that has as main authors Luis Razeto and Pablo Guerra. The second is the economic current of the solidarity economy with important authors such as José Luis Coraggio, Max Neef and Singer. In Europe, we find a vision called social economy, its main exponents are Jose Luis Monzón and Rafael Chávez in Spain and Jean Luis Laville in France. These definitions allowed us to discuss the denomination used in Colombia and confirm that the term solidarity economy represents in Colombia an important sector that encompasses countless organizations in different parts of the national territory. These organizations are based on collective and community work seeking the solution to specific problems. Solidarity economy is another way of looking at the relationship between economy, human and his context, where he bases his actions on loyalty practices with culture, humanity, territory, in search of a balance between being, having and living. In Colombia, through Law 454 of 1998 two types of organizations are distinguished, those of solidarity economy and solidarity developed, there are organizations of a solidary nature such as cooperatives, employee funds, mutual associations but also We recognize associations, corporations, foundations, volunteer groups, community action boards, among many others that respond to the conceptual and empirical characteristics of the solidarity economy mentioned below. The main conclusions refer to the characteristics of the solidarity economy in Colombia. From the social point of view, the solidarity economy is the means to achieve the social development sought by the territories. From the economic point of view, it is a new rationality of movement, use, accumulation and relationship between the economic factor and being. From the political point of view, self-management seeks the independence of the State in relation to its decisions. However, it is a movement that projects changes within public policy focused on equity between the social, economic, cultural and environmental. From the territorial aspect, it seeks to protect the development of the territory, coexisting with its geographic and cultural context, exploring new rationalities of territory from its socio-economic and cultural practices. From the cultural point of view, it seeks to recognize its origin in solidarity, cooperative and mutualist practices, striving to rescue them again, invigorate them and encourage them from and for the territories with new forms of organization. From the environmental aspect, it seeks the generation of territorial development balanced with the environment and its social context. From the organizational point of view, it is based on the participative, valued activity towards the human being and his capacities, the self-management, the associativity, the solidarity and cooperation are transversal in the organizational structures. From the individual, considers that the person is the end and not a means, take it to their freedoms is one of the purposes so that once free contribute to the overall development of society. Finally, it seeks the participation of the human being as the end of social, political, economic and cultural relations and realities, as a leading actor that seeks continuous but dynamic and changing development, guaranteeing solidarity, cooperative and respectful coexistence with others and their environment. Unlike Latin American countries such as Brazil, Argentina and Uruguay, in Colombia the solidarity economy hardly emerges as an incipient social movement, because it does not have enough identity to give it meaning given the existing heterogeneity and diversity of practices that could be categorized as solidarity economies. The social actors that are participating in the construction of the solidarity economy are varied and diverse; unions, universities, entities of the solidarity economy system, the State, the private sector, the church, international cooperation, organized civil society, popular rural and urban movements, which are called to the strength of the social movement seeking public policies that recognizes the importance of the solidary sector in Colombia. Some Colombian universities have developed since the mid-twentieth century, research programs made up of research groups that have different lines of work related to solidarity economy, as well as formal undergraduate and postgraduate and non-formal teaching programs such as continuing education programs. extension programs that mean work with the community and dissemination actions represented by journals, books, texts and academic events to present research results as well as national university networks (the Unicossol Network Corporation and Ciriec Colombia) related to international networks since decades ago, which have advanced significantly in the construction not only of the concept, but of a culture, movement and social force of the solidarity economy. These networks and research processes allow the solidarity economy to be recognized as a growing sector in the country, with important challenges in terms of the territorial reorganization that Colombia is currently experiencing, as a result of the negotiation processes with the armed groups. The solidarity organizations have emerged and continue to appear as a result of the absence of the State and the urgency of solutions to social problems that have arisen because of the war in Colombia. This particularity in Colombia makes the study of the solidarity economy urgent and necessary in a country where research has been difficult to develop, public investment in rural development processes, access to different territories, among others. Finally, the contribution of this article is based on the effort made by the Unicossol Network in recognizing the solidarity economy as the main source of development in Colombia. The union of researchers from different universities at national level, with different points of view and with experiences in the territory has facilitated the discussion and the approach to the definition of a term little studied in Colombia. © 2018 CIRIEC-España.",2018

Novel technological and management options for accelerating transformational changes in rice and livestock systems,Sustainability (Switzerland),"Agricultural producers grapple with low farm yields and declining ecosystem services within their landscapes. In several instances, agricultural production systems may be considered largely unsustainable in socioeconomic and ecological (resource conservation and use and impact on nature) terms. Novel technological and management options that can serve as vehicles to promote the provision of multiple benefits, including the improvement of smallholder livelihoods, are needed. We call for a paradigm shift to allow designing and implementing agricultural systems that are not only efficient (serving as a means to promote development based on the concept of creating more goods and services while using fewer resources and creating less waste) but can also be considered synergistic (symbiotic relationship between socio-ecological systems) by simultaneously contributing to major objectives of economic, ecological, and social (equity) improvement of agro-ecosystems. These transformations require strategic approaches that are supported by participatory system-level research, experimentation, and innovation. Using data from several studies, we here provide evidence for technological and management options that could be optimized, promoted, and adopted to enable agricultural systems to be efficient, effective, and, indeed, sustainable. Specifically, we present results from a study conducted in Colombia, which demonstrated that, in rice systems, improved water management practices such as AlternateWetting and Drying (AWD) reduce methane emissions (~70%). We also show how women can play a key role in AWD adoption. For livestock systems, we present in vitro evidence showing that the use of alternative feed options such as cassava leaves contributes to livestock feed supplementation and could represent a cost-effective approach for reducing enteric methane emissions (22% to 55%). We argue that to design and benefit from sustainable agricultural systems, there is a need for better targeting of interventions that are co-designed, co-evaluated, and co-promoted, with farmers as allies of transformational change (as done in the climate-smart villages), not as recipients of external knowledge. Moreover, for inclusive sustainability that harnesses existing knowledge and influences decision-making processes across scales, there is a need for constant, efficient, effective, and real trans-disciplinary communication and collaboration. © 2017 by the authors.",2017

Measuring organizational capabilities for technological innovation through a fuzzy inference system,Technology in Society,"As a result of the strategic and operational management of research in higher education institutions (HEIs), the organizational Technological Innovation Capabilities (TICs) contribute to reaching strategic objectives of transfer of results in research and development (R & D) to society and industry, for this reason, it is necessary to take measurements to identify the index creation and consolidation of organizational capabilities. Despite the importance, theoretically given to the TICs, a great gap is found in the scientific literature regarding the measurements of these capabilities in the higher education sector. In this paper, the results of the implementation of a fuzzy inference diagnostic system for organizational capabilities for innovation in a university institution (UI) in the city of Medellin, Colombia are presented. The system consists of the application of a structured diagnostic instrument - type interviewed-to the management and teaching staff of the institution. The data is adapted to the requirements of a fuzzy inference system, in which previously defined variables are related, their values are standardized and entered in an inference system. The values were implemented and processed in the Fuzzy Logic Toolbox - MATLAB. As inference system output, concrete numerical values, and surfaces of fuzzy inference were obtained to formulate organizational strategies aimed at improving the technological innovation capabilities of the institution. © 2017",2017

However, under the influence of the environmental reform of the 1990s in Colombia, the institutional framework sought to avoid the threat by leaning towards the decentralized management of sustainability and the application of economic instruments such as the compensatory rate (Pigouvian tax). The purpose of this article is to review the performance of these two standards against the role of civil society in the intervention on water quality in the high basin of the Cauca river. For this, the institutional analysis combined with econometric tools including models with panel, ANOVA and finally main components are used. In the end, the scope of civic citizenship as a complement or alternative to the typical tools of the regionalized public administration is discussed. The results show, among many others, the harmlessness of financial instruments such as compensatory rates to attack water contamination, along with the capacity of social organizations to control associative processes in defense of the river water quality. © 2017 Universidad de Caldas.",2017

"Intelligent higher education model based on competences and architectures for the Colombian post-conflict ,m","Proceedings of the LACCEI international Multi-conference for Engineering, Education and Technology","In our Colombian institutions, we find educational and entrepreneurial leaders who are technophiles towards systems based on knowledge and others, and on the other way, we find leaders with the technophobia towards those systems, situation that could act like a sword of double edge: expensive errors, vs. the unwanted Accountability. This seems common in third world countries. Intelligent Knowledge based systems (IKBS) have to do with the creation of value from intangible intelligent assets, that are resurrected from amalgams of Artificial Intelligence, Knowledge Engineering (KE), BUSINESS PROCESS REENGINEERING (BPR), Cognitive Systems Engineering, Software Engineering, and Third Millennium organizations, among others. Intelligent behavior requires being able to acquire and manage information, data and knowledge to make effective decisions for organizations to function intelligently in crises. Requires intellectually demanding environments with more open minds. The U. San Jose-FESSANJOSE has developed a supportive environment for decision-making in the complexity of higher education (HE), and a set of planning tools has been designed to deal with the crisis. These tools, are expected to help stakeholders develop and communicate understanding of high priority issues so that smart decisions can be made and implemented during crises in the case of Colombia. After 60 years of war confrontation (civil society, guerrilla, paramilitary) we are preparing toward a post-conflict situation; for labor re-qualification of thousands of victims a new education model based on integrating architectures and knowledge systems is proposed. The post-agreement implies greater social investment especially in education, towards the reconstruction of Peace and Equity that goes beyond social mobility (e.g. employment) with new educational models based on high quality and decentralization. Nowadays the Government of Colombia (GoC) signed an Agreement with the guerilla FARC after 6 years of talks. In the following days the Peace Nobel Prize was granted to the GoC President, Juan M. Santos. The following days new dialogues, with the minor and remaining guerilla ELN, was announced for starting soon in Ecuador. If succeed, the total peace will be warranted. The new educational model, involves: • Individual monitoring and evaluation, • guided by ICT (information and communicationstechnologies), • competencies (supported by KE) • asynchronous methodolyg, • personal tutoring: teaching/automated online (includingmobile devices usage), • for the population of young and adult, victims of armedconflicts, • for people preparation for the IV Industrial Revolution,and to face the transition to the Digital Transformation(to radically improve performance of institutions) Regarding the social situation, in our side we are preparing for a post-conflict situation; we have to prepare thousands of demobilized people and victims, requiring labor re-qualification. In addition, given the deficit of 100,000 ICT Engineers, and 300,000 Technologist (T) and Professional Technicians (PT), e.g. programmers; our proposal is intended as a disruptive innovation to address the post-war digital divide, and this country has based human talent mental rehabilitation, with training and labor requalification. We integrated our own experiences and proposed a new education model, based on the integration into an Intelligent Management Information System (iMIS), of 5 architectures that we previously have implemented in several higher education Institutions (HEI) in Colombia. Those architectures, supported by the convergence of Information, Software, and KE, with Artificial & Computational Intelligence, and guided by mathematical and computational models. iMIS integrates hybrid multilevel architectures with multilevel systems, in order to respond to the solution of HE-ME (middle education) problems, leading to face competitiveness and productivity, observing specifically how to include these technologies for evolving the university into modernity, bringing together the institution governability, the student and teacher productivity, and the High Quality Education (HQE). The paper characterizes an intelligent educational organization of the III millennium, defines post-conflict crises, and discusses a competency-based educational model as part of the alternatives to confront the national crisis with an educational crisis management framework.

"Clustering, innovation and hotel competitiveness: evidence from the Colombia destination",International Journal of Contemporary Hospitality Management,"Purpose: This paper aims to explore the relationship between clustering and hotel competitiveness in emerging economy destinations by analyzing potential mediation of the management innovations implemented. Design/methodology/approach: This empirical study is based on hotel-level information from a survey including 131 hotels in 2014. Colombia was chosen as a representative of Colombia, Indonesia, Vietnam, Egypt, Turkey and South Africa (CIVETS) emerging destinations. The relationships were analyzed by structural modeling and partial least squares. Findings: Clustering has a positive direct impact on hotel competitiveness and innovation, and there is a positive effect of innovation on competitiveness. Therefore, the link between clustering and competitiveness is partially mediated through implementation of management innovations. Practical implications: Hotels should actively participate in agglomerated destinations and build relationships with established firms by clustering. Interaction with related firms and implementation of management innovations will lead to increased levels of economic competitiveness. Public policymakers should foster collaborative strategic networking in the hospitality industry of emerging economy destinations. Originality/value: This paper focused on separating the direct and indirect effects of clustering on hotel competitiveness. Implementation of management innovations was considered as an outcome derived from clustering in emerging tourist destinations, using the example of Colombia. Clustering stimulates and eases management innovations within the location, and that combination reinforces the role that cooperating while competing plays in hotel competitiveness for destinations with lagging innovation. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.",2017
"Strategic orientation and strategies to manage organisational knowledge and creativity [Orientación estratégica, estrategias de gestión del conocimiento y creatividad organizacional]",Academia Revista Latinoamericana de Administracion,"Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to analyse the direct effects of strategic orientation in innovation and competition on personalisation and codification type knowledge management (KM) strategies and their organisational creativity. Design/methodology/approach: The authors counter-checked the hypothesis model with a sample of 169 companies in emerging markets that adopt technology: a country such as Colombia. To do so, the authors used structural equations with the least squares model. Findings: The data indicate that both KM strategies positively influence creativity; however, personalisation has a greater effect. Additionally, SG for innovation has a positive effect on both KM strategies; however, for competition, KM only has an influence on codification. Originality/value: The relation between KM strategies and creativity has been approached on a strictly theoretical level; therefore, this paper provides empirical evidence on the subject. It also establishes the direct effect that SG has on KM strategies, which have so far only been tangentially analysed. In so doing, it goes further than the limitations in the literature regarding analysis of the KM-creativity relationship, but it does not consider business strategy implications. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.",2017

Approach to differences in product and process innovation capabilities and financial performance in manufacturing companies,Espacios,"The purpose of this article is to explore the differences in product and process innovation capabilities (ICs) and financial performance (FP) in manufacturing companies in Colombia. In the methodology, a cluster analysis was performed which identified three groups of companies with similar characteristics: innovators, explorers and stragglers. An analysis of variance (ANOVA) was also performed to establish meaningful differences in the means. The results show that for product ICs there are significant differences in the development of routines aimed at developing environmentally friendly products and improvements in design. Meanwhile, for processing ICs there are significant differences with regard to the incorporation of basic but essential business technologies and the management of interrelated technologies. However, for financial performance differences are significant in terms of sales growth and increased market share. In conclusion, the development of product and process ICs does not guarantee better results in sales growth and market share compared with smaller companies that have made less of an effort to consolidate such routines. This is probably due to other organizational capabilities that may be more decisive in the commercial success of products. © 2017.",2017

Foresight study: Application of Delphi method in specialty coffees in Colombia to 2025 [Estudio de prospectiva: Aplicación del método Delphi en cafés especiales en Colombia al 2025],Espacios,"This article is the result of foresight study in specialty coffees in Colombia to 2025, which is part of the project ""Systematization and Knowledge Management for Antioquia project: Origin of Specialty Coffees"". The aim of the Delphi method was to identify and prioritize innovations, new business and diffusion strategies that were of importance in Specialty Coffees in Colombia. This study had consolidators on issues such as innovation, technology, new business and diffusion and marketing strategies. It is important to highlight that Delphi method was conducted in two rounds. Besides that, there were issues with consensus percentage between 50% and 75%. For example in innovations, seals combining marketing and fermentations controlled to induce sensory profiles coffee were made; in technologies: processes and benefit roasting profiles were the subjects of greater consensus. Additionally, in ""new business"", ecotourism and eco-organic products and new lines of business in the sector of specialty coffees were prominent. Also, the diffusion strategies that could be undertaken in the sector are clipping (media monitoring) and specialized databases. Finally, in common marketing code ""4Cs"" and system clean almonds are the most important.",2016
Determining factors in Colombian research groups' scholarly output [Factores determinantes en la producción científica de los grupos de investigación en Colombia],Revista Espanola de Documentacion Cientifica,"There is much debate about how knowledge-creating institutions -such as universities, research groups and centers- should be organized, as well as about the key processes of knowledge management to be applied by research groups and the financial, human and technological resources needed to achieve high performance in research. The current work, based on a theoretical review and empirical study, aims to determine the relationship of scholarly production results obtained by research groups affiliated with universities in Colombia in terms of the variables of organizational culture, knowledge management, and technological capital. For this analysis, a sample was obtained of 223 research groups that are recognized and categorized by the National Administrative Department of Science, Technology and Innovation (Colciencias, 2010). The data analyzed were obtained from a survey that measured the perception of leading researchers about such independent variables as university culture, knowledge management processes, and technological capital. The dependent variable of scientific production was analyzed based on the rating assigned to each group by Colciencias for research results obtained over a period of time. The statistical techniques used in this study are regression analysis and structural equation analysis by which it was determined that the following variables have a positive influence on the results of scholarly output: The motivating culture, process of outsourcing knowledge management, and technological capital. © 2016 CSIC.",2016
The SMEs' internationalization: Multicriteria-based priorization using fuzzy logic [Internacionalización de las PyMes: Priorización basada en multicriterios usando lógica difusa],Espacios,"Purpose. Develop a model based on a frame logic to quantify SMEs' internationalization by integrating linguistic variables such as human talent, infrastructure, innovation strategies, FTAs, marketing strategy and finance, among others. It is argued that the company management of international markets depends on internal factors, especially the capabilities and resources available, based on the premise that the profits made by a company depend on external factors (competitive environmental features) and internal factors (the integration of resources available), those latter are perhaps this research's biggest challenge, because it is required to propose a suitable battery of capabilities and define their importance and strategic relevance to building competitive advantages. Design/ Methodology/Approach. Fuzzy inference system is proposed to model the resources, skills and competencies that determine internationalisation success. Data: 157 linguistic variables are used, arisen from entrepreneurs, experts, consultants and researchers in international trade, and through expert judgment, 18 factors explaining export capabilities are defined. The proposed model is applied by means of a case study of the textile and clothing cluster in Medellin, Colombia. Findings. In model's implementing it got a particular global index of 28.2 for internationalisation capabilities. The result confirms the hypothesis that the capabilities and resources currently available to the sector analyzed, are not sufficient for a successful integration into the international market, and most importantly, specifies the factors and variables to intervene to improve the export's capability. Limitations. In the particular case of textile companies, is highlighted the lack of a continuous information record and very few studies directed towards the long-term plans development. Similarly, there is little consistency in the exports criteria. Originality/Value. Method emerges as an innovative management tool, linked to internal organizational spheres and their different abilities.",2016

Enterprise architecture of Colombian Higher Education,"Proceedings - Frontiers in Education Conference, FIE","Colombian Higher Education Enterprise Architecture is a framework for managing the system-of-systems lifecycle of Higher Education Programs. With this framework is possible to model scenarios about the government as a regulator of Higher Education services, the educational institutions as providers of higher education services and the different business and social sectors, and individual citizens as clients of higher education services. Under this perspective all the stakeholders can participate in the planning, development, transfer, use and control of all the products and services lifecycles of higher education in order to prioritize improvement alternatives and measure progress when it is moving towards excellence in training processes, research, innovation, development and knowledge transfer. CHE2A is a supportive environment for the management of higher education as a public service, which hosts the vision of 'Global Coalition Intelligent Network Services (-GIUNC-) to analyze and evaluate systematic, systemic and logistically, the characteristics of processes, outputs and outcomes and risks through key factors such as those proposed by the - GIUNC- itself, Registry of Qualification established by the Ministry of Education of Colombia or other similar factors established by national or international entities, from which, the stakeholders in the Higher Education services, interpret, evaluate, argue, propose, define, plan, implement and measure strategies, tactics and actions for improvement, innovation and development higher education programs.

An innovation model in curriculum design for teaching engineering at universidad EAFIT,"Proceedings - Frontiers in Education Conference, FIE","Constant changes in technology pose continuous challenges for higher education institutions that are training the engineers of the future. These changes are making it necessary to adapt the curriculum in order to develop the skills needed by the XXI century engineer. Moreover, instead of thinking in a large curriculum reform at a specific moment, it is necessary to define curriculum management processes that include change as a natural component of the process. In addition to these global trends, each institution has a particular context and thus, the analysis in each institution has unique characteristics, a common methodological approach, and a reference model that can be built as long as it is flexible enough to include that context. This paper describes a model developed for curriculum management inside the School of Engineering at Universidad EAFIT - Colombia. This model includes the institutional context and is based on a process approach defined by the Business Process Management (BPM) methodology. The model uses the Burlton Hexagon as a theoretical framework to identify organizational structure, strategies, policies, infrastructure, technology tools and human capital. It is also a mechanism for specifying curricular macro processes including the global and institutional context. The proposed model is based on three pillars: (a) scientific research in education, which promotes the use of the scientific method as a strategy to ensure an approach to problems based on evidence which allows the construction of educational innovation projects, (b) education engineering focused on engineering education, which transforms the learning by developing basic, professional, and transversal skills as well as those specific for an engineer of the XXI century, and (c) interactive educational communities, both face to face and virtual, as spaces for knowledge management that support collaborative working and experience-sharing, managed by its members working together promoting initiatives to develop educational innovation projects focused on specific topics, that answer questions related to teaching and learning needs. The formulation and development of educational innovation projects are the responses to different needs identified on specific courses that are transformed into research questions. These projects aim to renew the curriculum so that it dynamically evolves based on classroom experiences. Thus, the curriculum renewal is based on critical thinking about the problems found in engineering education. The use of the scientific method and the collaborative approach enables drawing solid conclusions based on the experimental results. The model proposes the formulation and development of innovative educational projects in which scientific research applied in education aims to transform teaching, academic and administrative practices. As consequence, curricular innovations that integrate learning objects and educational, methodological and assessment strategies, are developed by an interactive learning community composed by teachers. Finally, the results obtained by applying the model in some courses in the School of Engineering of Universidad EAFIT are presented. These results include reducing the drop-out rate of students, redefining admission and graduation profiles, and micro-curricular redesign based on competences using projects, among others. © 2014 IEEE.",2015
Knowledge management in research groups of higher education institutions in Colombia,"Proceedings of the European Conference on Knowledge Management, ECKM","The aim of the paper is to propose answers to the research question: What are the variables associated with knowledge management, which are conducted by the research groups of higher education institutions -HEI- in Colombia? This problem was identified by analyzing two major tensions. First, between the socially relevant knowledge and knowledge required by the market; and second, between the social research and research oriented by science, technology and innovation. These tensions put the knowledge management, which are conducted by the research groups, at the center of analysis. The methodology used is a case study of a qualitative and descriptive type, for which interviews and analysis of the curriculum vitae of directors and members of research groups were conducted. Review of literature on knowledge management was made, and research done on this topic by HEI. The findings are shown in three groups of variables associated with knowledge management: a) the research structure: planning, resource management, openness to change, leadership, teamwork, initiative, partnership, research training and employment; b) the research process: the problem and research questions, hypotheses, methodology, analysis and interpretation of results, participation in calls, regulation, research platforms and academic production; and c) the innovation process: prospective vision, interaction with the environment, creativity and use of information technologies. The findings indicate that the knowledge management in research groups, should be redirected through institutional policies articulated to the scientific and technological development. Although research groups perform activities resulting from the model of knowledge management (socialization, outsourcing, combination, and internationalization), these are not always practiced in a conscious way; and they also have structural difficulties during the research process, hindering the transfer of knowledge. Taking into account that HEI have integrated management systems that support the research process, it still requires improving the quality of these stages of management. The usefulness of the results leads to rethink policies that guide the processes of institutional research, and redirect knowledge management that is performed from the research groups. This for to move from the structuring of research problems arising from a weak conception of knowledge, to others where sociocultural realities are the benchmark for its formulation. Also aims to consolidate knowledge management from improving academic productivity of research groups, despite the risks of productivism. This is because the productivism is characterized by the proliferation of scientific papers based on the logic of the stacking, but, not of the knowledge creation and its social relevance.. Such practices transformed the publication, which it is a byproduct of the research, in a order of itself.",2015

Deep learning: The great challenge to innovate: Highlighting Colombia's food industry,"Proceedings of the International Conference on Intellectual Capital, Knowledge Management and Organisational Learning, ICICKM","In this century, organizations must read and understand their environment, develop compatible capabilities and transform if necessary to adapt to the new rules of the game of value and take appropriate decisions that will maintain them in the future. The ability to generate knowledge-based value not only depends on the individual company, but also depends largely on the ability to generate value of both the sector to which the company belongs and the economy of the native country. This document is the result of the analysis of the signals of the sector, second component of the preliminary stage of the DECK Study carried out by Bio Gerencia Virtual®. The main official sources of the food and beverage industry in Colombia were analyzed to detect the potential of this industry to create value by transforming knowledge into innovation. From analysis of the industry variables, signals that can become the basis for indicators are identified and propose a path of positive development for the sector: Transforming a traditional sector into one driven by knowledge. Peter M. Senge and others have referred to the deep learning cycle as the essence of the learning organization. When major changes are required, a deep learning cycle operates and can happen individually or collectively. In the Paisa Culture Prototype, a prototype of Knowledge Management for Innovation, whose base is the DECK Study, analyzes of specific sectors of the Colombian economy is included. If we understand each sector as a team able to create what it wants to create, the deep learning cycle will be relevant to each economic sector. In particular, the food and beverage industry of Colombia depends largely on the rich biodiversity of Colombia. The greatest opportunities for the sector can be found in the governmental purpose of transforming the Colombian industry. The food sector is at the center of this transformation; but, according to the findings, if the deep learning cycle is not activated, the transformation will not occur; and therefore neither will there be knowledgebased innovation. If the sector does not renew its thought model, it will not become an innovative sector. In the second part of the document, and with the representation of information of the business learning loop proposed by Haeckel and Nolan, work fronts in the sector are derived and some considerations are presented, taking into account issues of learning required to implement a traditional industry to become an innovative industry driven by knowledge. The outline of the document provides elements that are confined to the Detect Function and Interpret Function within the business learning loop. This cycle serves as a starting point to understand the deep learning cycle. It also refers to the collective learning that is perceived from the analysis that will be needed to increase the ability to compete in the sector.",2015

"Technological change and innovation in Latin American emerging economies: The pork industry of Antioquia, Colombia",Handbook of Research on Economic Growth and Technological Change in Latin America,"Innovation and technology, in appropriate business environments, are considered improvement and survival tools directly related to the establishment of competitive advantages. However, this must be accompanied by a growing economy, and, in some cases, governmental policies that encourage the industry. This chapter inquires about several factors involved in the innovation and technological change of the pork industry in Antioquia, Colombia, based on original research results and other contributions of the authors. The managerial assumption is simple: free trade and strategic moves of the biggest competitors indicate that Small- and Medium-Sized Enterprises (SMEs) in the pork industry must accelerate their technological change via innovation management by addressing different factors that are hindering the establishment of competitive advantages. The authors offer a possible path of action from a management perspective to support that the industry will form an oligopoly should innovation management not occur. © 2014 by IGI Global.

The maturity of capacities for innovation in Colombian enterprises [Madurez de las capacidades de innovación en empresas colombianas],Revista Venezolana de Gerencia,"Some of the great enterprises of Colombia, leaders in research, development and innovation, are located in the city of Medellin. However, to date, few studies have been made regarding the capacities for innovation underlying their good results in developing new and improved products. The objective of this article is to determine the maturity ofthe innovation capacities for five ofthese companies. The theoretical model of Essmann and Du Preez (2009) was used, which consists ofthree dimensions: a construct for innovation capacity, a maturity scale and an organizational construct. In terms of methodology, an index of innovative capacity was constructed and the ranges for three maturity levels were calculated, using the analysis cluster (Jung et al, 2009); this permitted classifying the companies under study. Results show that all the companies have a maturity level titled formalized and predictable. In conclusion, although the best practices associated with each innovation capacity have been identified and implemented, individuals have not appropriated them and do not use them in a systematic manner. © 2014, Universidad del Zulia.

Integral design tutoring model as a knowledge transfer strategy for SMEs in Colombia,9th International Conference on Design and Emotion 2014: The Colors of Care,"Colombia has been transformed into the third country with the best business environment in L.A.; however, investment in Research, Development and Innovation (RD&I) is only 0,2% of the GPD. Taking into account that 98% of the Colombian enterprises are SMEs, from which 5% invest only 2% of its annual budget in design, the National Industrial Design Program (MinCIT) saw the need to develop the Integral Design Tutoring Model. The model makes a bet for empathy and emotional intimacy as tools to transfer the necessary knowledge so that the local businessperson develops an innovation culture based on design thinking. To test the model, the Integral Design Tutoring Project was developed as a pilot. This fourmonths project allowed an interdisciplinary team, conducted by designers, to accompany twenty SMEs. Through a process developed in three stages it was possible to prove that, through empathy and emotional intimacy, one can achieve knowledge transfer to business people and their organizations in an effective, efficient and successful way.

A standardized trauma care protocol decreased in-hospital mortality of patients with severe traumatic brain injury at a teaching hospital in a middle-income country,Injury,"Introduction Standardized trauma protocols (STP) have reduced morbidity and in-hospital mortality in mature trauma systems. Most hospitals in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) have not implemented STPs, often because of financial and logistic limitations. We report the impact of an STP designed for the care of trauma patients in the emergency department (ED) at an LMIC hospital on patients with severe traumatic brain injury (STBI). Methods We developed an STP based on generally accepted best practices and damage control resuscitation for a level I trauma centre in Colombia. Without a pre-existing trauma registry, we adapted an administrative electronic database to capture clinical information of adult patients with TBI, a head abbreviated injury score (AIS) ≥3, and who presented ≤ 12 h from injury. Demographics, mechanisms of injury, and injury severity were compared. Primary outcome was in-hospital mortality. Secondary outcomes were Glasgow Coma Score (GCS), length of hospital and ICU stay, and prevalence of ED interventions recommended in the STP. Logistic regression was used to control for potential confounders. Results The pre-STP group was hospitalized between August 2010 and August 2011, the post-STP group between September 2011 and June 2012. There were 108 patients meeting inclusion criteria, 68 pre-STP implementation and 40 post-STP. The pre- and post-STP groups were similar in age (mean 37.1 vs. 38.6, p = 0.644), head AIS (median 4.5 vs. 4.0, p = 0.857), Injury Severity Scale (median 25 vs. 25, p = 0.757), and initial GCS (median 7 vs. 7, p = 0.384). Post-STP in-hospital mortality decreased (38% vs. 18%, p = 0.024), and discharge GCS increased (median 10 vs. 14, p = 0.034). After controlling for potential confounders, odds of in-hospital mortality post-STP compared to pre-STP were 0.248 (95%CI: 0.074-0.838, p = 0.025). Hospital and ICU stay did not significantly change. The use of many ED interventions increased post-STP, including bladder catheterization (49% vs. 73%, p = 0.015), hypertonic saline (38% vs. 63%, p = 0.014), arterial blood gas draws (25% vs. 43%, p = 0.059), and blood transfusions (3% vs. 18%, p = 0.008). Conclusions An STP in an LMIC decreased in-hospital mortality, increased discharge GCS, and increased use of vital ED interventions for patients with STBI. An STP in an LMIC can be implemented and measured without a pre-existing trauma registry. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.",2014
The transition to a teaching hospital: Patient satisfaction before and after the introduction of medical students,Medical Teacher,"Background: Several studies have explored the effect of the presence of medical students on patient satisfaction. However, nearly all of these studies took place in hospitals where medical students had been involved in patient care for many years. Less is known about patients' perceptions of care in a hospital moving toward becoming a teaching facility with undergraduate students. No research has explored patient satisfaction before and after the introduction of medical students. Objective: To assess patient satisfaction as an indicator of quality of care (QoC) from the patients' perspective, before and after the presence of medical students in a general hospital setting. Methods: This observational, cross-sectional study was conducted at Hospital Universitario-Fundación Santa Fe de Bogotá (HU-FSFB) in Bogotá, Colombia. The study had two phases. In 2006, prior to HU-FSBF becoming a teaching hospital, 385 subjects were asked to fill out a closed-question questionnaire addressing patients' satisfaction and perception of QoC provided by attending physicians. During the second period in 2009, 372 patients answered the same questionnaire when medical students were involved in their care. Results: Patients' perceptions of QoC provided by attending physicians improved in five aspects when medical students were present: friendliness (p = 0.003), competence providing medical care (p = 0.049), quality of information provided (p = 0.025), amount of time spent with the patient (p < 0.001) and availability to personally provide care (p < 0.001). Overall patient satisfaction also significantly increased (p < 0.001). Conclusions: The presence of medical students does not negatively affect patients' perceptions of QoC, on the contrary, these results provide evidence of improved patient satisfaction in several aspects of care when medical students were involved. The relevance of this study lies in its unique way of comparing patient satisfaction before and after the introduction of medical students. This setting helps elucidate the real effect of the presence of medical students on patient satisfaction. © 2014 Informa UK Ltd.

A Strategy for Scaling-Up Intensive Silvopastoral Systems in Colombia,Journal of Sustainable Forestry,"Silvopastoral systems (SPS) enhance milk and meat production and are instrumental for the productive rehabilitation of degraded lands. Intensive silvopastoral systems (ISPS) combine fodder shrubs planted at high densities (&gt;10,000 plants ha-1), trees and pastures. Scaling-up such systems requires incentives to address financial and knowledge barriers. In Colombia, the strategy for scaling-up SPS has combined five elements. First, participatory research on real farms contributed to optimize SPS in different agroecosystems and strengthened a network of pilot farms open to research and peer-to-peer technology transfer. Second, capacity building, training, and outreach activities spread the principles of SPS among farmers, field workers, researchers, extension workers, and policy makers. Third, pilot projects explored the role of incentives such as Payment for Environmental Services (PES), technical assistance, soft loans and bonus prices, in spreading SPS. Fourth, successful pilot projects were instrumental in influencing the livestock sector as well as the public policy agenda. Fifth, currently, large-scale projects aimed at mainstreaming SPS are applying the lessons learned in order to achieve landscape-scale benefits, enhance climate change adaptation and mitigation, and introduce SPS products to green markets. Recently, innovation networks have contributed to speed up the adaptation of SPS in different environmental and socioeconomic contexts. © 2013 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",2013

"Informal irrigation in the colombian andes: Local practices, national agendas, and options for innovation",Mountain Research and Development,"Knowledge about the extent of irrigated land in Colombia is scarce because most irrigation is done informally and therefore not registered. Informal irrigation in Colombia has not been investigated, its national presence has not been identified, and its characteristics are still unknown. The present article aims to help fill this gap. Because of topographical and agricultural patterns, Andean informal irrigation is impossible to identify or characterize using standard methods. To provide information on the scale of informal irrigation systems in Colombia, their type, the users they serve, and the type of water sources they use, a large-scale partial inventory was made combining statistical analysis, questionnaires, interviews, and field trips. The findings indicate that informal irrigation is widespread in the country's mountainous zones, in a great diversity of environments, characterized by an equally great diversity of local uses and water-use strategies. This diversity has resulted from the coexistence of very different community and state institutions, posing challenges for planning and organizing water-resource management more efficiently and sustainably for producers, the government, and other stakeholders.",2013
Characteristics of Randomized Trials Published in Latin America and the Caribbean According to Funding Source,PLoS ONE,"Introduction: Few studies have assessed the nature and quality of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC). Methods and Findings: The aims of this systematic review are to evaluate the characteristics (including the risk of bias assessment) of RCT conducted in LAC according to funding source. A review of RCTs published in 2010 in which the author's affiliation was from LAC was performed in PubMed and LILACS. Two reviewers independently extracted data and assessed the risk of bias. The primary outcomes were risk of bias assessment and funding source. A total of 1,695 references were found in PubMed and LILACS databases, of which 526 were RCTs (N = 73.513 participants). English was the dominant publication language (93%) and most of the RCTs were published in non-LAC journals (84.2%). Only five of the 19 identified countries accounted for nearly 95% of all RCTs conducted in the region (Brazil 70.9%, Mexico 10.1%, Argentina 5.9%, Colombia 3.8%, and Chile 3.4%). Few RCTs covered priority areas related with Millennium Development Goals like maternal health (6.7%) or high priority infectious diseases (3.8%). Regarding children, 3.6% and 0.4% RCT evaluated nutrition and diarrhea interventions respectively but none pneumonia. As a comparison, aesthetic and sport related interventions account for 4.6% of all trials. A random sample of RCTs (n = 358) was assessed for funding source: exclusively public (33.8%); private (e.g. pharmaceutical company) (15.3%); other (e.g. mixed, NGO) (15.1%); no funding (35.8%). Overall assessments for risk of bias showed no statistically significant differences between RCTs and type of funding source. Statistically significant differences favoring private and others type of funding was found when assessing trial registration and conflict of interest reporting. Conclusion: Findings of this study could be used to provide more direction for future research to facilitate innovation, improve health outcomes or address priority health problems. © 2013 Reveiz et al.",2013

Intellectual assets and knowledge engineering method: A contribution,Advances in Intelligent Systems and Computing,"The Higher Education Institutions, HEI are the natural space where the ethos of knowledge can be developed and the Intellectual Capital, IK can be accumulated. It's no secret the inadequacy of the Management Information Systems, MIS to incorporate knowledge. In fact is shared by many authors that well over half the market value is explained by the IK in companies of the Third Millennium. Traditional systems do not account for the IK and only estimate the book values vs. market values when selling focused on negotiation processes. On the other hand, there are already quite a few financial models of the knowledge economy that considers the IK. For the universities is a critical issue in the way of the Competitiveness of Higher Education. Our initiative EIDOS constituted unconventional ideas that have not had an audience in the context of Colombia. Now beginning to break through what an open space is required with basic units in the enterprise architecture of the HEI focused on innovation; This was stated by the Government Plan 2010-2014, in this country as an national strategy. These new architectures must be defined and supported in order to facilitate the stream of information and knowledge with new sources of generation, especially those where the IK did not exist. It begins to think that IK is the basis of sustainability and financial governance. Knowledge Engineering (KE) maturity level is inderway. As background it should be mentioned that this research originated to facilitate the use of development methodologies, information systems and evolve them to the incorporation of layers of knowledge for an Intelligent Management Information IMIS, to the various organizational and technological changes that occur in building new systems to meet customer requirements in improvement of processes, new demands of companies in the Knowledge Society and basically make the intelligent performance of the firm. Our research effort represents ongoing work with several University projects and unpublished graduate works and also consulting works for institutions in Colombia. In the FESSANJOSE the model has evolved to our proposal of social innovation Leontief Model that incorporate the knowledge sector.

Knowledge sharing and innovation in Spanish and Colombian high-tech firms,Journal of Knowledge Management,"Purpose: The aim of this paper is to empirically test the degree of influence of different knowledge sharing mechanisms (ICT-based, personal interaction-based, and embedded in management processes) on innovation capability (both on ideation and on innovation project management), as well as the influence of each first-level innovation capacity on company performance. Design/methodology/approach: A questionnaire was designed and addressed to the CEOs of the companies making up the target population (Spanish and Colombian medium-high and high technology firms with more than 50 employees and R&D activities). Structural equation modelling (SEM) based on partial least squares (PLS) was then applied to test the hypotheses drawn from the research. Findings: The results obtained show that knowledge sharing is a key issue in order to enhance innovation capability. With the exception of ICT-based knowledge sharing mechanisms (whose influence on the generation of new ideas is not statistically significant), all types of mechanism considered exert a significant impact both on ideation and on innovation project management (although their degree of relevance varies), and account for a great deal of variance in both constructs. Differences between countries arise when it comes to the influence of each first-level innovation capacity on company performance. Research limitations/implications: Traditional limitations of cross-sectional studies apply. Originality/value: The main contribution of this paper is to provide empirical evidence about the impact of knowledge sharing on innovation. Moreover, it reveals what the most effective knowledge sharing mechanisms are for this purpose and provide companies with a basic framework in order to shape their knowledge management strategies in this domain. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.",2012

Innovation indices of the Colombian industrial groups from two national innovation surveys,"PICMET: Portland International Center for Management of Engineering and Technology, Proceedings","This paper seeks to contribute to the analysis of innovation in the Colombian industry (at group or 2-digit ISIC level) using data from the first two national innovation surveys. This is pursued by means of Innovation Indices, from which it is sought to identify regional and national special features, while allowing international comparative analysis, along the lines of the Oslo Manual. The work highlights the limitations of the information available to carry out the calculation of innovation indices as proposed in the recent literature on the subject. As an alternative, a methodology based on the Importance Value Indices (IVIs) is applied, which allows the calculation of new innovation performance indicators amenable to international comparisons. By applying multivariate statistical techniques, redundant information of a high number of variables is cleared to construct the IVIs; then, clustering and characterization of the different units of analysis is performed using a model that connects the variables refined. The paper concludes with an exercise of innovation analysis applied to industrial groups in Colombia, using IVIs constructed with data from the first two national innovation surveys. © 2011 IEEE.",2011
Local disaster risk reduction in latin American urban areas,Environment and Urbanization,"It is widely acknowledged that disaster risk reduction is a development issue best addressed locally with community involvement, as an integral part of local development. Yet there are many constraints and realities that complicate the attainment of this ideal. This paper reviews the experience in disaster risk reduction in a range of cities, including Manizales, Colombia, which has integrated risk reduction into its development plan and its urban environmental management. The city government has also established an insurance programme for buildings that provides coverage for low-income households. The paper further describes and discusses the experiences of other city governments, including those of Santa Fe in Argentina and Medellín in Colombia. It emphasizes how, in order to be effective, disaster risk reduction has to be driven locally and must include the involvement of communities at risk as well as local governments. It also has to be integrated into development and land use management. But the paper emphasizes how these key local processes need support from higher levels of government and, very often, inter-municipal cooperation. Political or administrative boundaries seldom coincide with the areas where risk reduction needs to be planned and implemented. The paper also includes some discussion of innovations in national systems and funds to support local disaster risk reduction. © 2011 International Institute for Environment and Development (IIED).",2011

"Seismic innovation challenges for developing stratigraphically complex mature oil fields: An example from VMM, Colombia",SPE Latin American and Caribbean Petroleum Engineering Conference Proceedings,"Spatial distribution of sand bodies with the capacity of storing hydrocarbons follows complex patterns in reservoirs deposited in fluvial environments. Understanding this distribution is one of the most important factors to consider in the planning and management of any development strategy. Usually, a vertical distribution of the sand bodies is obtained from well logs, core description, and outcrops added with sedimentation and depositional modeling using different techniques. This information is transferred to 2D and 3D stratigraphic models in correlations and stratigraphic panels. Despite of model depuration and tuning with development information, uncertainty is still very high. The acquisition of 3D multi-component seismic information was defined as the tool to reduce this uncertainty in the volumetric distribution of sand bodies and their connectivity, to build the geometry of the reflectors with the wave field P, identifying the lithology and the presence of fluids. A pilot of this technology was designed in the Tenerife field (Middle Magdalena Valley Basin, Colombia) focused in obtaining information of the Mugrosa formation, of Oligocene age, composed basically by sandstone deposited in thin fluvial channels, primarily meandering. To obtain the planned outcome, a high density design (480,000 traces / km2) was developed to allow a sufficient relation signal/noise in the S wave. Non conventional field tests allowed the design of the parameters of charge from the energy source and the depth of the receptors. For the static solutions, multi-component ""upholes"" and the description of the shot point (SP) where tested to allow a geological model of the strata that could be related with the velocities of the P wave and S wave. The innovative design for the management of the combination of seismic attributes of the S wave and P wave has shown considerable advantages in the definition of the sand bodies in fluvial environments as heterogeneous as this case. This innovation opens immense possibilities for the development of similar fields in the Middle Magdalena Valley Basin as in other regions of the world with similar deposits.

Research in human and social sciences under the scheme of the university-business-state model: A view from the critical theory of society [La investigación en ciencias sociales y humanas bajo el esquema del modelo universidad - empresa - Estado: Una mirada desde la teoría crítica de la sociedad],Revista Interamericana de Bibliotecologia,"The Sistema Nacional de Ciencia, Tecnología e Innovación de Colombia -SNCTeI- (Colombia's National System of Science, Technology and Innovation), as an element of its managment strategies, is in the process of incorporating a new model of innovation called «triple helix», that tends to transform the traditional formation and investigation oriented University of into a business oriented university. This paper essays an approach to the impact that the strategies of the model of science, technology and innovation on the research activity in humanistic and social areas, in the frame of knowledge management. It will begin by taking into account critical theory and its conception of instrumental rationality, which will allow to show the problems that this kind of rationality poses to research in human and social sciences. The methodology of this research is qualitative and exploratory, developed through interviews directed to researchers in this area of knowledge, responsible for administration and management, to those who design the policies of public and private universities, and to governmental organizations. These interviews pretend to show their appreciations on the impact that these new policies and management strategies will have on human and social sciences. One of the conclusions of these study is that the new model of innovation, called triple helix, pretends that universities lead initiatives and finance the creation of technology based companies. This causes the researchers in human and social sciences to try to adapt themselves to the parameters set by this model, which leads to a blurring of their objects of study, and to the risk that the research on their area is limited to the narrow margins allowed by the commercialization of its results. © 2009 Escuela Interamericana de Bibliotecologia.

The processes involved in a management model for university patents [Los procesos en un modelo de gestión de patentes universitarias],Ingenieria e Investigacion,"Current tendencies in strengthening intellectual property rights and the emergence of new scientific-technological fields (such as nanotechnologies, biotechnology, telematics and software development) have forced universities to acquire sufficient knowledge aimed at protecting their research results and fulfilling a leadership role within their regional settings so that they may generate competitive innovation strategies in alliance with other social agents. However, universities must promote ethical values, respectting and defending their countries' ecological and cultural heritage when intellectual property rights are being promoted. A model for managing universities' industrial property rights is thus proposed here; it is centred on patents so as to improve strategies contributing towards Latin-American universities' scientific and technological development and thereby contribute towards their countries' development. The model is one of the relevant results derived from the theoretical framework for research carried out by the team from 2003-2007 and from the empirical study carried out in two phases. The first phase consisted of a survey whose objective was to detect critical aspects regarding managing patents and licenses for universities in Colombia, Chile and Spain.

"Administrating a ""virtual"" research centre: the case of the colombian centre for innovation in floriculture",Computers in Agriculture and Natural Resources - Proceedings of the 4th World Congress,"Colombia is the second largest world flower exporter. This leadership was achieved in part by the adaptation of imported technology. However, the special conditions of the production areas particular to the high tropics and increased international pressure require that the producers combine their efforts to increase productivity and competitiveness. To meet this challenge, the Colombian Association of Flower Exporters (Asocolflores) recently established the Colombian Centre for Innovation in Floriculture (Ceniflores) as a scientific, technological, independent, private, and non-profit institution. Research investment is long term and has proven high rates of return in other commodities. Due to limited funding, the flower sector needs adequate tools to manage it strategically. A research plan based on grower demand is the starting point for the Centre, which acts as ""virtual"" articulator between producers and research institutions, nationally and abroad. To achieve its objectives, Ceniflores has acquired a systems infrastructure built completely on Internet through a WEB-based architecture. This allows for information collection from multiple sources, its integration, and analysis. The information is available to different stakeholders through articulated networks (Business Web [B-Web]) built around the services offered, including access to documents, projects, research priority questionnaires, databases, and topic-based research networks, among others. The technology used is based on various open source applications, dramatically reducing time and cost to implement each of the services. Furthermore, the use of existing applications and how they have been integrated, allow replication of the model by other centres that require the creation of WEB based networks.",2006
Technology management as a strategic and operational planning tool for departments of information [La gestión tecnológica como herramienta de planeación estratégica y operativa para las unidades de información],Revista Interamericana de Bibliotecologia,"Based on the Model of Management of Technology (GT) for Information Units (UI) of the Universities of Medell n, the authors have selected and adapted a GT model that integrates the settings in which the academic IU operates in terms of its administrative tasks and its strategic and operational planning, specifying the components of each and the GT tools that make their interaction possible, in addition to measuring and controlling its development and applications to the various processes of the UI. This article presents a condensed report of this research project, in particular the results of the diagnostics of the UI belonging to institutions of higher education in Medell n, Colombia, the relation between the diagnostics and the model, the critical factors that may be obstacles for the GT in a UI. It also serves as a proposal for a system of management indicators for the GT processes. © 2005 Escuela Interamericana de Bibliotecologia. All rights reserved.",2005
Assessing options for an Innovative Malaria Control Program on the basis of experience with the New Colombian Health Social Security System,Revista de Salud Publica,"Objectives Designing and proposing alternative models for municipal and Departmental malaria control programmes based on evidence obtained concerning the process of malaria on the Colombian Pacific Coast and regarding key problems in the malaria control programme before and following health system reform in 1993. Methods An evaluative study was carried out, comparing the situation before and following the 1993 reform; model design was also compared. Control programme is understood as being the institution, the human group and administration in charge of control activities. The study was carried out in 2002 and 2003, in the Departments along the Colombian Pacific Coast; the four departmental capitals, 28 malarial and 5 control municipalities were included primary and secondary information was obtained by means of surveys and semi-structured interviews, community meetings and reviewing documentation in the secretariats of health, the Vector-borne disease control programme-VBDC, the Expanded Immunisation Programme-EIP, Health Promoting Entities-HPE, Subsidised Regime Administrators-SRA and Service-Providing Entities-SPE. Results The following results were obtained: 1. Illustrating and analysing malarial tendencies in the country and on the Pacific Coast, and the corresponding institutional transformations in the programme; 2. Characterising the control programme which existed before 1993; 3. Characterising departmental modes of decentralising the programme; 4. Identifying the effects of reforming the system and characterising control programme problems; 5. Comparing the programme with the Expanded Immunisation Programme (EIP); 6. Comparative analysis of the programme and identifying current gaps in management capability; 7. Actors' perceptions regarding the control programme; 8. Values and challenges for an innovative control programme; and 9. Designing a model for up-dating/adapting the control programme. Discussion Malaria control programmes' problems and weaknesses are frequently and inarticulately attributed to the lack of knowledge and management skill of personnel working in such programmes, the lack of an information and communication system or weaknesses in the municipalities or personnel. These factors may well have had an effect; however, a global and institutional approach leads to locating the programmes within a social, political and cultural context. This allows interpreting control programmes' current problems, amidst decentralisation and reform processes, and linking this interpretation to modelling and opening a space for innovation in such programmes. The study's main limitations spring from particularities regarding Pacific Coast control programmes and weakness in health information systems.",2004
Terrorism in Colombia,Prehospital and Disaster Medicine,"Colombia is a poor country that has been plagued by ongoing violence for more than 120 years. During the 1940s, subversive terrorist groups emerged in rural areas of the country when criminal groups came under the influence of Communism, and were later transformed into contemporary groups, such as the Ejercito de Liberacion Nacional (ELN) or National Liberation Army and Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionares de Colombia (FARC) or Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia). Paramilitary terrorist groups emerged in response to subversive groups and were later transformed into contemporary groups, such as the Autodefensas Unidas de Colombia (AUC) or United Self-Defense Forces of Colombia. Terrorism has placed an enormous burden on modern Colombia. From 1995 to 2002, 9,435 people were killed by terrorism-related events, of which 5,864 were killed by subversive terrorist activities and 3,571 were killed by paramilitary terrorist activities. In 2002, at least nineteen attacks produced 10 or more casualties, of which 18 were bombings. In 2002, terrorists killed at least 12 mayors, 71 legislators, and internally displaced 300,000 persons from their homes. Since terrorist groups in Colombia are typically supported by drug manufacturing and trafficking, it has been difficult at times to distinguish violence due to terrorism from violence due to illicit drug trafficking. Terrorism has also had a major adverse effect on the economy, with restricted travel, loss of economic resources, and lack of economic investment. In addition to political, military, and commercial targets, terrorists have specifically targeted healthcare infrastructure and personnel. At the national and local levels, much emergency planning and preparedness has taken place for terrorism-related events. The Centro Regulador de Urgencias (CRU) or Emergency Regulation Center in Bogota plays a major role in coordinating local prehospital and hospital emergency response in the capital city and the national level where necessary. © World Association for Disaster and Emergency Medicine 2003.",2003
"Agenda 21; A form of joint environmental management in Manizales, Colombia",Environment and Urbanization,"This paper describes the development of Bioplan-Manizales. a local environmental action plan (LEAP) for the city of Manizales, and the different groups that contributed to its development: also, how this plan became integrated into the municipal development plan and the municipal budget. The measures taken to monitor and evaluate the social, economic and environmental effects of the environmental policy are also described and these include a series of urban environmental observatories. The paper also describes the broader national and international context for the innovations in Manizales - including the political, legislative and fiscal changes in Colombia that have encouraged local authorities to develop local environmental agendas. Manizales' own historical development is described including the environmental changes that this development brought and the environmental problems that it precipitated.",1998
